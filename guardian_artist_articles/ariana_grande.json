        "bodyText": "There\u2019s some kind of magic afoot. If, like me, you\u2019re one of the very few people who hasn\u2019t already seen the blockbuster stage musical Wicked (it\u2019s the second-highest-grossing Broadway show of all time, so that\u2019s an awful lot of bums on seats), you may approach this shiny, high-energy, relentlessly marketed movie adaptation with low to moderate expectations. There\u2019s the unwieldy running time, for a start \u2013 two hours and 40 minutes \u2013 and the cynical, box-office-gouging decision to carve the story into two films (fans will have to wait almost a year to the day before they get to watch the concluding chapter). But here\u2019s the thing: reservations are soon extinguished and grumbles about the release strategy swiftly quashed. Wicked matches its polished razzle-dazzle with real heart. Driven by knockout performances from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, Jon M Chu\u2019s impossibly slick charm assault of an adaptation zips along so enjoyably that you almost wish it were longer (your bladder may disagree). With its all too timely themes of bullying, corrupt leaders and the demonisation of difference, this is a movie that promises a froth of pink and green escapism but delivers considerably more in the way of depth and darkness. For those who have somehow evaded Wicked\u2019s cultural reach over the past couple of decades, here\u2019s a brief primer. The film and the stage show are both loosely based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, which offers an alternative backstory for the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz. This film focuses on Wicked\u2019s early years and two young witches-to-be: green-skinned outcast Elphaba (Erivo), who will go on to become the Wicked Witch of the West, and the vain, popular Galinda (Grande), who will eventually blossom into Glinda the Good. Both Elphaba and Galinda are newly arrived at Shiz University (think the student politics of Mean Girls\u2019s North Shore High and the curriculum of Hogwarts). Although not enrolled as a student, Elphaba is on site to help her paraplegic younger sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode). But the formidable teacher Madame Morrible (a haughtily fabulous Michelle Yeoh, breezing over any vocal limitations in a cloud of intimidating glamour) spots potential in Elphaba and offers her one-to-one tutoring in the art of enchantment. To the mutual disgust of both girls, Elphaba and Galinda find themselves assigned as roomies. It\u2019s not just their personalities that clash: the film\u2019s colour palette is at first a battleground between the chlorophyll green of Elphaba\u2019s skin and the candyfloss pink of Galinda\u2019s wardrobe. But visuals that initially seem jarring start to find harmony as the movie progresses. A scene in a forest full of mossy tuffets of vegetation and garlands of delicate, rosy blooms is lush and lovely, one of several notable triumphs for the production design department, led by Nathan Crowley, whose credits include the similarly lavish Wonka. Likewise, Elphaba and Galinda warm to each other and a genuine connection is forged between them. Both lead actors impress. Erivo is terrific, her rich, velvety voice cracking under the weight of rejections and ridicule suffered by Elphaba; her eyes showing the bruises that her skin cannot. And Grande is supremely well cast. It\u2019s not just the voice: the singer has a vocal range so extensive that some of it is only audible to bats, and she uses every last note of it here. But more crucial is her gift for physical comedy \u2013 each flouncy hair toss, each ditsy heel kick, is a precision-tooled punchline. Elsewhere, Bridgerton\u2019s Jonathan Bailey, as the shallow and self-absorbed Prince Fiyero, skips away with every one of his scenes \u2013 in particular, a dizzyingly complex song-and-dance sequence in the college library. Kudos, too, to the choreographer Christopher Scott for dreaming it all up, and to cinematographer Alice Brooks for capturing the magic. Does it all work? There are moments that get too caught up in their own whirl of CGI pageantry and empty spectacle. And certainly some scenes could be tightened up a little \u2013 it\u2019s worth noting that the running time of this first film instalment is longer than the stage version in its entirety. But for the most part, Wicked the movie takes flight and lifts our hearts along with it. We\u2019re caught in the slipstream of Elphaba and her knobbly and uncomfortable-looking broomstick as she whooshes off into the second half of the story. In UK and Irish cinemas",

        "trailText": "Stephen Schwartz\u2019s musical prequel has been brought to the big screen, with Erivo\u2019s charismatic Elphaba exerting a planetary pull over a star-studded cast",
        "bodyText": "As Kermit the Frog and the Hulk discovered: it\u2019s not easy being green. Now another verdant character is gleefully brought to the screen by lyricist-composer-producer Stephen Schwartz, screenwriters Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox, and director Jon M Chu in an adaptation of Schwartz\u2019s Broadway musical, the first of two parts. It\u2019s a sugar-rush fantasy with the overpowering star presence of Cynthia Erivo; it basically dunks you face-down in a hyperreal ball pit of M&amp;Ms for two and three-quarter hours. I don\u2019t have showtune-rapture in my DNA but this movie made a cleaner, sharper, cartoonier kind of sense to me than the stage show which I saw back in 2011. This film is the prequel origin myth for Schwartz\u2019s emerald supervillain-hero, stratospherically upping her status in retrospect: the green-faced Wicked Witch of the West from the 1939 movie classic The Wizard of Oz, based on L Frank Baum\u2019s children\u2019s tale. It was a character shriekingly played in the original by Margaret Hamilton, terrorising Judy Garland\u2019s Dorothy, and now we are given a backstory for the pointy hat, the broom-transportation, the inky cloak (though shrouding the protagonist\u2019s biological father in mystery). It pulls off the cheeky trick of making us interested in someone we know is destined for an ignominious death by water. How did she get to be so mean? Could it be that what we interpret as meanness is a mythological distortion of strength and defiance? We see her early life as Elphaba, a green-skinned woman who shows up at the Shiz University for witches in Oz and has to share a room with a legally-blonde Insta princess, Galinda, who will grow up to be the Good Witch of the North. Both will have feelings for aristocratic classmate Prince Fiyero and both will meet their destiny on encountering the legendary, insidious Wizard of Oz himself. The Wizard is played with his usual drolly syncopated line-readings by Jeff Goldblum; Michelle Yeoh is stately school principal Madame Morrible; Jonathan Bailey uncorks an outrageous scene-stealer as the heterocamp Fiyero, a performance to put alongside Cary Elwes in The Princess Bride; and Andy Nyman is winningly melancholy as Elphaba\u2019s dad, the governor of Munchkinland. (The film rather fudges the identity-issue of the munchkins, making them hardly different in height from the rest of the cast, perhaps due to contemporary views of the offensiveness of the original film\u2019s Munchkins.) Ariana Grande plays Galinda, an almost translucent figure of gauzy delicacy, appearing as if perched on top of an invisible Christmas tree and though not a natural comic like Reese Witherspoon or Alicia Silverstone, she gets the laughs like the smart player she is. But the sledgehammer punch is delivered by Erivo as the wounded, angry, alienated Elphaba. In Sunset Boulevard, Norma Desmond famously said that the movies once only needed faces \u2013 and Erivo\u2019s face is the ground zero of this film\u2019s blast of entertainment power. She is the film\u2019s Rushmore: charismatic, haughty and vulnerable. Her face exerts a planetary pull on everything else on screen and an impossible thing to look away from. She carries the big songs like The Wizard and I, and she and Grande are great in the mysterious scene in which Elphaba arrives at a party, is humiliated in her outfit, goes into a series of mysterious dance moves which may or may not be an attempt to style out some failed revenge-spell-castings and Grande\u2019s Galinda finally joins her on the dancefloor mirroring her moves, the unlikely beginning to their friendship. It\u2019s arguable if Wicked could ever be a meaningfully persuasive prequel for the characters in The Wizard of Oz as we actually see them in the 1939 film, as this would involve cancelling their powerfully timeless, mythological aura, and instead substituting the more banal idea of human development. But this is the joke, and this is the story, and what an enjoyable spectacle it is. \u2022 Wicked is out in the UK and US on 22 November, and in Australia on 28 November.",

        "trailText": "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande honor city in performance while host Conan O\u2019Brien discusses fires in monologue",
        "bodyText": "Conan O\u2019Brien briefly discussed the Los Angeles wildfires and \u201cdivisive politics\u201d while delivering his opening monologue at the 97th Academy Awards. \u201cThe people of Los Angeles have clearly been through a devastating ordeal and this needs to be addressed,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIn moments such as this, any awards show can seem self-indulgent and superfluous, but what I want to have us do is remember why we gathered here tonight.\u201d He then celebrated those behind the scenes in Hollywood, like the \u201ccraftspeople, technicians, costumers\u201d \u2013 the \u201chard-working men and women behind the camera who have devoted their lives to making film\u201d. O\u2019Brien continued: \u201cEven in the face of terrible wildfires and divisive politics, the work, which this is about, the work continues. And next year, and for years to come, through trauma and joy, this seemingly absurd ritual is going to be here \u2026 the magic, the madness, the grandeur and joy of film worldwide is going to be with us forever.\u201d To kick off the show, the broadcast from the city\u2019s Dolby Theater opened with a shot of the Hollywood sign, with the voice of Judy Garland saying There\u2019s No Place Like Home. The Wizard of Oz reference gave way to a montage of movie scenes filmed in Los Angeles, from Mulholland Drive to Barbie, La La Land to Iron Man, Her to Everything Everywhere All At Once, ending with the message: We &lt;3 LA. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the stars of the Wizard of Oz prequel Wicked, continued the tribute with performances of Somewhere Over the Rainbow (Grande) and The Wiz\u2019s Home (Erivo). The duo then joined forces for Wicked\u2019s signature track, Defying Gravity, before Erivo took on the climax with a shot of the glittering LA skyline in the background. After their performance, O\u2019Brien emerged from Demi Moore\u2019s back in his monologue opener, paying homage to the grotesque visuals displayed in the Oscar-nominated film The Substance. \u201cIt\u2019s Hollywood\u2019s biggest night that starts at four in the afternoon,\u201d said the comedian as he began. \u201cBut it\u2019s the Oscars and I say let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d In his more than 10-minute speech, O\u2019Brien poked fun at Netflix (\u201cNetflix leads all studios with an impressive 18, count them 18, price increases\u201d), Oscar-nominated films The Brutalist (\u201cI loved The Brutalist, I really did. I didn\u2019t want it to end. And, luckily, it didn\u2019t.\u201d) and Conclave (\u201cA movie about the Catholic church, but don\u2019t worry\u201d), and actress Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n (\u201cAnora uses the F-word 479 times. That\u2019s three times more than the record set by Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s publicist\u201d). O\u2019Brien offered levity by taking aim, in small part, at Amazon. He said that founder Jeff Bezos had been seen on the red carpet, before panning over to a staged Amazon delivery driver throwing a package at the heels of an Oscar statue. He then noted that Bezos wasn\u2019t seen inside the Dolby Theatre before panning back over to a man in black seemingly stealing the package that contained Bezos. After showing off some old headshots of Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Guy Pearce and a sonogram of Timothee Chalamet, O\u2019Brien did a bit with Adam Sandler, who appeared in what has become his uniform these days: a hooded sweatshirt and basketball shorts. O\u2019Brien concluded his monologue with a musical number where he repeatedly said he wouldn\u2019t waste time all while dancing beside a sandworm from Dune 2 playing piano and a dancing Deadpool. Sunday night\u2019s show marked the first time the late-night legend hosted the telecast. Fellow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel previously hosted the Academy Awards in 2017, 2018, 2023 and 2024, revealing last year that he had turned down a request to host in 2025. On the selection of O\u2019Brien, the Academy chief executive officer, Bill Kramer, and the Academy president, Janet Yang, said in a statement that he was the \u201cperfect person to help lead our global celebration of film with his brilliant humor, his love of movies, and his live TV expertise\u201d. \u201cHis remarkable ability to connect with audiences will bring viewers together to do what the Oscars do best \u2013 honor the spectacular films and film-makers of this year,\u201d they said. Later in the broadcast, O\u2019Brien brought out a team of firefighters who braved the Los Angeles fires to the stage. \u201cOn behalf of everyone in greater los Angeles, thank you for all that you do,\u201d he said, before introducing three of the Los Angeles fire department (LAFD) members to do some jokes of their own. Capt Eric Scott deadpanned: \u201cOur hearts go out to all of those who have lost their homes and I\u2019m talking about the producers of Joker 2.\u201d Capt Jody Slicker took aim at the host himself, telling the audience: \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back with Conan - usually when he calls, he\u2019s stuck in a tree.\u201d Read more about the 2025 Oscars: Anora takes home best picture Oscar Adrien Brody and Mikey Madison win best acting prizes Kieran Culkin and Zoe Salda\u00f1a win supporting awards Anora\u2019s Sean Baker wins for directing, editing and screenplay",

        "headline": "Why Wicked should win the best picture Oscar",
        "trailText": "With its real tulips, real singing and real BFFs Ariande Grande and Cynthia Erivo front and centre, this musical is as authentic and credible as fantasy gets",
        "bodyText": "For the opening scene of Wicked, 9m real tulips were planted, improbably, by a farmer in Norfolk. The necessity of this opulence was completely obvious to director Jon M Chu and production designer Nathan Crowley \u2013 otherwise they\u2019d have to use CGI for the Munchkin Village. Is CGI lush? Does it recall the heady, future-facing surge of hope and optimism that the original Oz has come to represent for, goddammit, almost a century? It does not. While it isn\u2019t for the production values alone that Wicked deserves the best picture Oscar \u2013 anyone can spend money if they have enough money \u2013 take a second to consider the commitment of this film, and its impossibility. It tries to remain true to the moment when the world discovered Technicolor (sure, sure, come at me with The Toll of the Sea some other time); cheerfulness, magic, a naive faith in cinema and beyond \u2013 these are quite big asks in 2024, and Wicked went for it. It was partly in tribute to that quality of early musicals that Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande performed all the songs live; lip-syncing as an innovation has brought increased slickness to a movie\u2019s sound quality, but at the expense of stripping out jeopardy and emotion from the human voice. Clearly, Erivo and Grande could both lift a building off its foundations with their vocals \u2013 the last thing you\u2019d describe them as being is \u201cfragile\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s a \u201cwhites of their eyes\u201d thing. You never realised you needed to see the muscles move in a singer\u2019s throat to believe that they really mean it \u2013 yet it turns out, you do. If it were just down to Erivo or Grande\u2019s performances, then obviously the case would be for best actress/support. But forget screen chemistry, these two are like an actual chemical reaction together \u2013 hydrogen and oxygen fusing to become something entirely new, with its own properties. It\u2019s not completely fanciful that TikTok is convinced they\u2019ve fallen in love in real life, nor that What Is This Feeling? is such a strong song, when it\u2019s not actually the strongest song. They have multiple matching tattoos! They burst into tears whenever they see each other! To be honest, if ever there\u2019s a musical on the Oscars shortlist, I would always lobby for that over a non-musical. People think the form is schlockier and therefore easier, but in fact it is better and therefore harder. The original musical which this adapts is a bit of a head-scratcher, to be honest \u2013 there are scores which you love instantly for obvious reasons (My Fair Lady, Cabaret), and ones that you love instantly for reasons you can\u2019t figure out (Hamilton). Wicked is a grower, many of the melodies aren\u2019t that catchy, often the motifs relate in ways you only realise after multiple listens. It\u2019s the musical equivalent of going to a Pixies gig where they\u2019re only going to play their latest album. You wouldn\u2019t want to arrive at it cold. But, again, there\u2019s that sense of confidence and commitment \u2013 let\u2019s not make it shorter, to cater to the 21st-century attention span. Let\u2019s split it in half, and make both halves unimaginably long. Everyone will fall for it, if they give it enough time. Time, we have (this first instalment is 2hrs 40min. I\u2019ve seen it on the 22nd of every month since it came out, so I\u2019m confident I could pass the GCSE). The dialogue is also sharp but unobtrusive. It\u2019s not played for laughs, but when there is one (Jonathan Bailey, saying \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u201d; Erivo replying, full of consternation: \u201cI heard\u201d), it stands out, elegantly. And Jeff Goldblum \u2013 whose high-camp shtick can be jarring to a plot, reminding you insistently that, whatever else is going on, that\u2019s definitely Jeff Goldblum \u2013 has found his happy place, as the Wizard. Not wanting to be sacrilegious, the animal subplot didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense in the musical, which Stephen Schwartz, composer and lyricist, has acknowledged. Why would the Wizard want to empower the monkey army, in order to spy on the talking animals? Why not just maintain a monkey army in their non-flying state and just subjugate the rest of the animals some other way? \u201cWe wanted to ditch it because it was so confusing,\u201d Schwartz said in 2000, adding \u201cbut so much of the plot hinges on it, so there is nothing that can be done.\u201d The film has given Dr Dillamond, the talking goat, political resonance and emotional heft, introducing totalitarian overtones without which the central dilemma \u2013 does Glinda choose Elphaba or conventional society? \u2013 would fall apart. If it weren\u2019t Elphaba v the fash, you\u2019d automatically side with Glinda. She seems so nice, and Elphaba is green.",

After years of speculation, more casting rumors than Oz\u2019s population of flying monkeys, a production ripe for tabloid fodder, and a massive marketing and promotion machine worthy of a wizard himself, Universal\u2019s epic musical Wicked has finally walked the yellow brick road that leads into theaters. On Thursday night the first official screenings unfolded around the US, including at New York City\u2019s AMC Empire 25, the multilevel cathedral to cinema just off Times Square. It proved to be perfect moviegoing weather outside: absolutely miserable with hard, cold rain. Inside, there was a palpable energy with superfans lining up for one of the theater\u2019s whopping 32 screenings of the film to handle demand, with box office tracking estimating the movie will \u201cwin over the world\u201d with a massive global opening set to hit about $200m (the film made over $19m in US previews last night, not far off Barbie\u2019s $22m in 2023).

Much like gazing at the sparkling Emerald City itself, critics seem to be in universal awe. \u201cIf it feels like they made the best Wicked movie money could buy,\u201d said the Associated Press\u2019s Jocelyn Noveck. \u201cWell, it\u2019s because they kinda did.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s own Peter Bradshaw marveled, \u201cWhat an enjoyable spectacle it is,\u201d while Vanity Fair\u2019s Richard Lawson went so far to say the film stands as an \u201cunreproducible, lightning in a bottle convergences of director, stars, craftspeople, and high-status material\u201d. Gabby and Rachel, friends from Brooklyn who trekked to this AMC despite the windy downpour, wore pink and green, a play on the film\u2019s prominent colors. \u201cWe\u2019re excited, but we\u2019re not superfans,\u201d they pointed out, noting a desire to participate in a cultural moment akin to Barbie. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the Twitterness of it all.\u201d Meanwhile, Travis from nearby Queens showed up dressed in a witch\u2019s hat and black mesh top and shorts. \u201cI remember I saw the musical in previews when I was in eighth grade when nobody knew what it was or what it was going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve probably been insufferable because I\u2019ve been listening to the soundtrack non-stop. I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled.\u201d It\u2019s all not for a lack of trying. Stephen Schwartz\u2019s opus first premiered on stage back in 2003, and the 1995 novel he based that on (Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West) was originally going to be a movie itself. By 2012, Universal came on board with an original release date of 2019. That was shifted, then the pandemic didn\u2019t help things move along any more quickly. After Jon M Chu (known for Crazy Rich Asians and his adaptation of In the Heights) was announced to direct in 2021, the show\u2019s diehard fanbase waited with bated breath for casting news as the film found itself as one of the buzziest projects in Hollywood. Lady Gaga, Shawn Mendes and even Jennifer Lopez are all rumored to have been vying for roles. The film-makers wound up settling on a potent duo: in one corner is Ariana Grande, the pop star who put her music career on hold for the role of Glinda, originated by Kristin Chenoweth. \u201cWhen something once in a lifetime, like this, happens, every single second counts,\u201d Grande said in a recent interview of her decision to put all of her musical eggs in the Wicked basket. In the other is Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, originated by Idina Menzel. At the time of her casting, Erivo, who was perhaps best known for her Tony-winning role in The Color Purple as well as her eponymous turn as Harriet (Tubman), said she didn\u2019t even think she\u2019d be considered in the first place. \u201cHistorically, Black women have never really been seen for the role,\u201d she recently said. \u201cIf they have, they haven\u2019t gotten the role, and if they do, they usually are the alternate or first cover.\u201d The combination of Grande and Erivo has also energized the film\u2019s aforementioned, all-encompassing press blitz which not only featured a much-talked about Super Bowl spot (the public\u2019s first sneak peek) but collaborations with brands such as H&amp;M and REM Beauty as well as Wicked-branded Rice Krispie treats, Betty Crocker mix and even Walmart\u2019s curious Wicked macaroni and cheese, which teases a mystery color (naturally, pink or green). Here at the AMC theater, not only were there branded Wicked popcorn buckets, but audiences could also slurp down an Enchanted Green Apple Icee inspired by the film. That\u2019s not to say there were some awkward moments along the way, from Erivo\u2019s admonishment of a seemingly innocent fan-altered poster (\u201cThis is the wildest, most offensive thing I have seen\u201d) to the tabloid fodder concerning Grande and co-star Ethan Slater\u2019s scandalous on-set romance. Then there\u2019s the tragedy that some fans have been, gasp!, singing along at advance screenings, prompting warnings from theater owners. Inside the theater for my 7pm showing, after previews the lights went down for a custom welcome package from the Wicked cast as the audience cheered. \u201cNo singing, no wailing,\u201d Grande and Jeff Goldblum, who plays the Wizard, could be heard saying. Naturally, they applauded again for Nicole Kidman\u2019s viral ode to film (\u201cSomehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this\u201d). Finally, after 21 years of anticipation, the film began and a title card eventually appeared: Wicked: Part One. Yes, there\u2019s another film flying down to theaters in exactly one year from this day; a polarizing choice that screamed money grab to some and \u201cthe more, the better\u201d to others. For the superfans I spoke to, everyone was well aware, and pleased, there would be no final resolution by the end of its 160-minute runtime. While audience members at my screening dutifully followed the no-singing rule, they did clap and hoot vociferously after almost every musical number and throughout a set of surprise cameos. So what did the diehards think after the screening? \u201cTen out of ten,\u201d said Travis, still in his black witch hat. John, another fan from New York, agreed. \u201cI think they nailed it from top to bottom. I think it\u2019s better in some ways than the musical.\u201d And in case audiences didn\u2019t get enough, venturing to the subway underneath the theater you\u2019ll find that Universal Pictures even teamed up with the MTA, with the entrance plastered entirely with pictures of the cast. Only 364 days until Part Two.",

        "trailText": "In the earnest press tour for the film, actor Cynthia Erivo was in tears at the idea that fans were \u2018holding space\u2019 for the song Defying Gravity. But is it more self-help jargon or something more powerful?",
        "bodyText": "The journalist Tracy E Gilchrist had just four minutes with the Wicked actors Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande \u2013 and she had to make them count. She just didn\u2019t bargain on becoming part of one of the year\u2019s most-used memes as a result of saying the phrase \u201cholding space\u201d. \u201cI just went in and did my job, which was to try to get an authentic answer to a question in a very short amount of time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt like the right term for what I was trying to get across to Cynthia, which is the idea that you can interact with a work of art like Defying Gravity and feel something within yourself.\u201d In the interview \u2013 a standard junket affair of rotating film journalists \u2013 Gilchrist, teeing up her question, informs Erivo that \u201cpeople are taking the lyrics of Defying Gravity and really holding space with that and feeling power in that\u201d. If the comment itself was slightly left-field, Erivo\u2019s teary response was even more so. \u201cThat\u2019s really powerful,\u201d said the British actor, who plays the lead role, Elphaba, in the screen adaptation of the stage musical. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted,\u201d she added, as her co-star Grande gripped her index finger. It was the latest stop on an exaggeratedly earnest press tour that has included the actors revealing matching lyric tattoos on Kelly Clarkson\u2019s talkshow. Gilchrist\u2019s question reflected the rise in popularity of the phrase \u201cholding space\u201d, a companion term to popular self-help concepts such as \u201cemotional bandwidth\u201d and \u201cdrawing boundaries\u201d. But what does it actually mean? And how do you hold it for the lyrics of a 20-year-old Stephen Schwartz musical number? \u201cTo me, it means to be in the moment,\u201d says Gilchrist, who was working for Out magazine. \u201cTo be fully open to something and to not be cynical. To hear something \u2013 maybe a song like Defying Gravity that you have heard hundreds of times \u2013 and to have it hit you in a new way.\u201d So just sort of \u2026 being there? \u201cIf it was a few years ago, I might have said \u2018people are feeling seen\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can feel seen by a work of art, or a song, or another person, so I think it can be very similar.\u201d Heather Plett, a Canadian writer and coach who runs a workshop on holding space on Vancouver Island, says it\u2019s a concept that she has been workshopping for 15 years. \u201cThe way I define it is that it\u2019s a practise that we do when we show up for another person in support of whatever they\u2019re going through. We do that without judgment, or without trying to layer our own story on to theirs, and we offer them compassion and support while allowing them to have their own sovereignty.\u201d The etymology of the term is hazy, but it may have something to do with Donald Winnicott\u2019s writing on the maternal holding environment in the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 or what would probably be called, in 2024 parlance, a safe space. Lesley Caldwell, a psychoanalyst and honorary professor at University College London, says: \u201cHolding relates both to the question of what happens in an analytic session and what the analyst provides [for a patient]. It is also derived from the idea of what a mother does with a baby \u2013 though we might now extend that to the caregiver. The question is: what are the conditions in which a safe space is established and how can that continue to be established internally by someone as a result of the early infant care they experience?\u201d It\u2019s hardly the first instance of therapy-speak bleeding into everyday conversation \u2013 \u201cinner child\u201d and \u201crepression\u201d hark back to Freud. \u201cThere are quite a lot of phrases like this, for example: \u2018This is triggering,\u2019\u201d says Peter Kinderman, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s using psychological jargon in everyday life to confuse.\u201d \u201cI think we feel that if we have a specialist term for something that it legitimises it,\u201d says Hazel Price, a lecturer in English language at the University of Salford, who first encountered the term in a neonatal group. \u201cWe tend to use expert language because it somehow legitimises something that actually isn\u2019t rooted in any kind of rigorous evidence.\u201d But Benjy Kusi, a 29-year-old inclusion and wellbeing consultant, insists that some in the LGBTQ+ community have been using it for years. \u201cI would say in the queer spaces I\u2019m in that it\u2019s used quite often. I facilitate workshops in regard to topics like anti-racism and LGBTQ+ inclusion, and in such sessions I hold space for people to share their lived experiences.\u201d Is any phrase bad \u2013 even if it\u2019s jargon \u2013 if it encourages compassion? \u201cI\u2019m just happy that we are having some joy and that most people are coming together as a community and having fun with it,\u201d says Gilchrist. She doesn\u2019t regret asking the question.",

        "bodyText": "Name: Cinema singalongs. Age: Hard to tell the exact origin but the most recent example is just days old. Appearance: Like a film, but with a badly malfunctioning soundtrack. You mean singing along to a movie in the cinema? Yes, exactly. You can\u2019t do that. Not normally, no. Not ever! It\u2019s the most antisocial thing I\u2019ve ever heard of. But what if you just can\u2019t help yourself? Then you should see a doctor. And stay out of cinemas. Fans beg to differ. Fans of what? Fans of Wicked, the Wizard of Oz-inspired stage musical, which has now been released as a film. They love the songs so much \u2013 and know them so well \u2013 they have reportedly been belting them out during early screenings. If they were real fans, they would show more respect to \u2026 erm \u2026 To Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, the stars of the film? Yes, but also to other audience members, who paid to hear Grande and Erivo, not some random person two rows back. Management agrees with you: cinemas in the US have put up signs asking the audience to refrain from singing along. Glad to hear that the rules still matter. Not everyone supports the policy, however. \u201cSing! You\u2019ve paid your hard earned money for a ticket, and you\u2019ve gone into a musical, and you\u2019re into it,\u201d said ex-wrestler Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. I must say, I didn\u2019t expect to hear him weigh in on the matter. Perhaps you weren\u2019t aware that Johnson voices the character Maui in the animated Disney musical Moana, whose sequel premiered this weekend. Does the Moana franchise face the same issue? It could do \u2013 the original was beloved and a live-action remake is in the works. I now feel caught between The Rock and a hard place. Is there a solution? North American cinema chains have already announced special singalong screenings of Wicked, where joining in will be welcomed. Has such a thing ever been tried before? It has. In 1999 there was Sing-a-Long-a Sound of Music, an audience participation version of the 1965 film with subtitled lyrics. And that was a success? Yes, one that was repeated with many other films: Sing-a-Long-a still tours British cinemas with similarly adapted versions of Grease, Encanto, Dirty Dancing and The Greatest Showman. Although I hate to see this sort of thing encouraged, I accept a compromise is called for. When can I start avoiding singalong screenings of Wicked? You\u2019re safe until Christmas. Do say: \u201cGood news! She\u2019s dead! The Wicked Witch of the West is dead!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cCan I bring my dog? He loves singing along to stuff.\u201d",

The drama ensemble category will see Sh\u00f4gun and The Diplomat face off against Slow Horses, Bridgerton and the first season of The Day of the Jackal. The comedy ensemble has The Bear competing with Hacks, Abbott Elementary, Only Murders in the Building and Shrinking.

        "trailText": "The high-couture styles of the film version of the hit show reflect a trend of designer daring on the stage",
        "bodyText": "Musicals used to be associated with glee club kids more likely to be wearing jazz shoes than anything cutting edge from the catwalks. But with the film version of Wicked \u2013 which was released this weekend and was expected to take more than $100m (\u00a380m) at the US box office alone \u2013 promoted by global pop star Ariana Grande and actor Cynthia Erivo wearing Vivienne Westwood, Schiaparelli and Louis Vuitton, musicals are having a pitch-perfect style moment. Even before it opened, there was a glut of Wicked collaborations across skincare, haircare and hoodies \u2013 more than 400 in total, including Gap, Kipling, Crocs, H&amp;M, Claire\u2019s Accessories and Marks &amp; Spencer. Fancy London department store Liberty, with its tasteful Tudor-beamed building, has teamed up with Universal Pictures to make over its windows Wicked-style. Ryan McBryde, former artistic director at the Mercury theatre in Colchester, who has worked on many musicals, said: \u201cOz is depicted in Wicked as a kind of high-fashion, elitist society. They\u2019re all dressing in high couture.\u201d He added: \u201cIt makes perfect sense that those companies should buy into that.\u201d That a musical \u2013 albeit one in the cinema rather than on stage \u2013 is having such a jazz-hands fashion moment arguably reflects a wider trend. On Broadway, a revival of Sunset Boulevard, starring former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, has received attention for what the Washington Post called its \u201cJil Sander-chic costumes\u201d. The costumes of Cabaret at London\u2019s Kit Kat club \u2013 the leather, the lingerie \u2013 all could have seamlessly sashayed on to spring/summer 2024 catwalks. Plus, Prada and Chanel are centre stage with the new musical of The Devil Wears Prada that recently opened in London\u2019s West End. Red carpets have for a long time been fashion\u2019s best marketing tool, while costume designers use contemporary fashion as a way to connect to audiences and welcome new ones in. David Benedict, the London theatre critic for Variety, notes that \u201c[costume] designers are looking to place things in a way that people can read\u201d. Soutra Gilmour, who was the costume designer for Scherzinger\u2019s Sunset Boulevard, wants \u201cthe people on stage to reflect and speak to the people in the audience, to be of the same world, to connect through the proscenium\u201d. Clothes, she says, \u201care a great way to support that \u2013 it\u2019s a language we all read very quickly\u201d. Enver Chakartash is to thank for the fashion-forward ensembles of Romeo + Juliet, now on Broadway. While it is not strictly speaking a musical, Jack Antonoff, songwriter and producer of Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter, wrote two original songs for the show. \u201cIt was important for the costumes to feel of-the-moment in terms of how young people present themselves,\u201d says Chakartash. Hence why those costumes include Ludovic de Saint Sernin and Adidas, as well as Vaquera and Salomon. For the balcony scene, they dressed Juliet in a vintage Vivienne Westwood Care Bear T-shirt. While McBryde points out that musicals \u201calways had a kind of relationship with modern fashion\u201d \u2013 he cites Coco Chanel working with Jean Cocteau in the 1920s and Halston working with Martin Scorsese on The Act with Liza Minnelli in the 1970s \u2013 he thinks that \u201cthe difference between then and now is the proliferation of imagery that you can get on the internet\u201d. Crossover between the two worlds is happening more and more: Es Devlin has designed for musicals as well as for Stormzy, Lorde, Beyonc\u00e9, Louis Vuitton and YSL. Tom Scutt, the designer responsible for the Cabaret costumes, has worked with Sam Smith. Of course some of this fashionable moment for musicals might also be down to chance. That the recent West End production of Oklahoma! felt so on trend was in part thanks to the rise of cowboycore. Still, there is a drive for modernity within musicals. \u201cEverybody wants to do a take on the show that hasn\u2019t been done before,\u201d says Chakartash. \u201cA lot of the time that leans into making it feel contemporary and relatable and also aspirational. \u201cWhen you go to Cabaret, you\u2019re like: \u2018Where can I find that seafoam-green coat that looks like [it\u2019s] straight off the Gucci runway?\u2019\u201d When you go to Wicked, you leave wanting to find emerald green, pastel pink and bubble skirts.",

        "trailText": "The Academy Award nominees assembled for their annual group portrait, but who scooped the prize for looking the most bored?",
        "bodyText": "Every year during Oscars week, it has become tradition for all the nominees to meet up and eat a meal together. This is usually followed by a group photo; something that the people in attendance can look back upon and cherish, knowing that for this one moment all competition fell away and they found joy in surrounding themselves with their gifted colleagues. At least that\u2019s the idea. As anyone who has ever been in a group photo will attest, these things are an absolute mess. There are simply too many people to control, and the resulting image is generally a free-for-all of weird costumes, odd expressions and seemingly hostile body language. As such, let\u2019s use this year\u2019s Oscars class photo to hand out some awards of our own. Most recognisable: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande (front row, centre) This is less a category, more a shameful admission. The Oscars are the biggest night of the movie-industry calendar, and I make a living from writing about the movie industry, and yet I do not know who most of these people are. If this photo proves anything, it\u2019s that the films you enjoy are often made by people so anonymous that you wouldn\u2019t give them a second look if they tripped over a bag on a bus. So thank God for the stars of Wicked, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, for at least making an effort. Yes, it helps that they\u2019re among the most famous people in the room. Yes, it helps that they\u2019re sitting in the front row. Yes, it helps that they seem to have dressed expressly for the purpose of standing out in a group photo, and seem much happier to be there than anyone else. But mainly, it helps that I know who they are. Congratulations! Most keen to distance themselves from all this: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (third row from back, far left) Forget anything I said about this photo being a chummy opportunity for the participants to demonstrate that they are part of a wider community. Honestly, just look at the body language on Chalamet here. His face is a tight rictus grin of reluctance. He is leaning away from his neighbour with his entire torso, the way you would if a foul-smelling stranger plonked themselves next to you on a park bench. Most strangely, he seems to be raising a fist, as if he\u2019s getting ready to punch his way out of the room. The poor boy seems to be having a nightmare. Least able to look at the camera: James Mangold (second row from back, far right) James Mangold, your job is literally photographing people. You\u2019ve become one of our finest film-makers because you are good at taking people and getting them to stand in the correct poses in front of a camera. And yet look at you. Everyone else is looking at the photographer, but not you. You\u2019re staring at the guy in front of you, lost in a world of your own. Would it kill you to tilt your chin up a little bit? You have no choice but to make another good film this year so you can try to look at the camera properly when this picture is taken again a year from now. Oddest squish: Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Mikey Madison (front row, left of centre) It\u2019s genuinely hard to say what\u2019s going on here. Most of those in attendance get to sit in regular cinema seats, except for a few people at the front who are sitting on chairs that have been placed in the spots reserved for wheelchair users. Four people sit in four chairs placed on the right-hand side of the photo. Four chairs also appear to have been placed on the left-hand side, yet five people are sitting there. Indeed, Andrew Watt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Mikey Madison appear to be squeezed on to just two seats. Why is this? There are plenty of empty seats elsewhere in the auditorium. One of them could have gone to sit next to Chalamet. It might have even cheered him up a bit. My guess is that someone threw a gigantic fit about their allotted seat placement and crammed themselves into the front row, to the discomfort of those around them. The question is: who? Most visibly bored: Diane Warren (fourth row, sixth from right) Another year for Diane Warren, another nomination for a song in a film that nobody has heard of. Another looming Oscar night bound to end in disappointment. Warren\u2019s entire aura is screaming, \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over and done with.\u201d And who can blame her? Most needless Muppet death: unknown subject (front row, third from right) Sorry lady, I don\u2019t know who you are, but Elmo did not deserve to end his life for this. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 February 2025 to remove text that was based on a misidentification and included in error.",

        "headline": "Wicked would be fun and forgettable but for the alt-right waging its dark arts against it | Kate Maltby",
        "trailText": "Digital crusade by anti-woke warriors against a vapid film for teen girls should be sending a wake-up call to Hollywood",
        "bodyText": "The \u201cwar on woke\u201d has a new target and her name is the Wicked Witch of the West. If you\u2019re a fan of the musical Wicked, you\u2019ll also know her as Elphaba, the moniker imagined by Gregory Maguire in his 1995 prequel to L Frank Baum\u2019s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. As played by Margaret Hamilton in the 1939 movie, she was the nemesis of Judy Garland\u2019s Dorothy; as played this year by the musical theatre star Cynthia Erivo, she has conservative men across Britain and America bursting their blood vessels. Since Maguire came up with his novel \u2013 an extravagant piece of fan-fiction that suggests this \u201cwitch\u201d might simply have been misunderstood \u2013 it has been reinterpreted as a stage musical and now as a movie in two parts. Wicked\u2019s target market consists of teenage girls who see themselves in this backstory for Elphaba and her college-friend-turned-rival, Glinda the Good Witch. In the 21 years since Stephen Schwartz\u2019s adaptation opened on Broadway, the show has been a cult phenomenon among young musical fans, blithely ignored by everyone else. Now the screen version has brought into mainstream conversation and the land of Oz has become a battleground in America\u2019s culture war. As a musical, Wicked is harmless to the point of vapid. Winnie Holzman\u2019s storyline for the show is a more anodyne affair than Maguire\u2019s hallucinatory fever dream of a book, which included bestiality and orgies. It features Elphaba as a talented girl arriving at a magical college, only to be bullied by Glinda and a clique of rosy-cheeked sycophants because she happens to have been born with green skin. This is Mean Girls meets Hogwarts. It has two songs you\u2019ll remember: Popular, in which Glinda reveals the secrets of social success, and Defying Gravity, in which Elphaba vows to pursue excellence and fight prejudice. Wicked is sweet and fun and ultimately forgettable. All of which makes it sad to watch Jon M Chu\u2019s movie become a flashpoint for grown adults. Since opening last weekend, Wicked has been subject to increasingly rabid media attacks. Some of this follows a familiar pattern: outrage for clicks. It is no surprise that Erivo, a black woman who describes herself as queer, has been the target of particular bile. Yet take a look at the organised and powerful social media accounts pushing attacks on Erivo, and it becomes clear that Hollywood is facing a new type of challenge. Wicked has been released into a landscape in which well-funded political marketeers are adept at turning key cultural moments into wedge issues. These are darker arts than anything conjured by the Wicked Witch of the West. Film studios need to decide whether to respond by leaning into the politics of polarisation, ramping up a strategy that already targets movies at different segments of the US electorate, or by making the case for blockbusters that can still bring progressives and conservatives together. The attacks on Wicked range from the plausible to the overtly ridiculous. British media outlets objected to a British Board of Film Classification note that expounded on its PG rating by explaining that the movie featured \u201cdiscrimination\u201d. \u201cSeeing beloved characters being mistreated, especially when Elphaba\u2019s skin-colour is used to demonise her as the \u2018Wicked Witch\u2019, may be upsetting and poignant for some audiences,\u201d says the advice. Piers Morgan was among those who denounced this as the working of the \u201cwoke brigade\u201d. Has he seen Wicked? Sure, BBFC advice to parents can be po-faced and limiting. But the BBFC has been issuing such warnings since 1912 \u2013 following a Daily Mail campaign against an early screen depiction of Jesus \u2013 which hardly makes it the cutting edge of wokery. Morgan\u2019s complaint seems to be that it is \u201cnonsense\u201d to claim that a movie about bullying based on skin-colour could be understood as an allegory for racism. Which is a bit like objecting to a note that The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe might be an allegory for Christianity. More serious attacks on the film, however, have emerged from a cluster of high-impact, anonymous accounts on X (formerly Twitter) that have flourished in the era of Elon Musk. One such, an account named \u201cEnd Wokeness\u201d, was set up a few months after Musk bought the platform and already boasts 3.3 million followers; its banner image is a photograph of a bloodied Donald Trump raising his fist after surviving an assassination attempt. Elsewhere on X, an account named \u201cDefiant L\u2019s\u201d has joined the game. It is linked to a website named \u201cResist the Mainstream\u201d, which the Bloomberg news agency has traced to a Macedonian-based disinformation network pushing conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and Trump\u2019s 2020 electoral loss. Defiant L\u2019s has been endorsed by Elon Musk as \u201cone of the best accounts on X\u201d. The attacks on Wicked promoted by these accounts have received widespread coverage. They blame Erivo\u2019s casting on \u201cwokeness\u201d and complain about munchkins being played by actors of average height, instead of dwarves as in the Oz movie. A video clip pushed out by the End Wokeness account went viral after it showed Erivo and her co-star, the singer Ariana Grande, holding hands emotionally while a reporter asked them to comment on the LGBT community \u201cholding space\u201d for the song Defying Gravity in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election victory. (The phrase \u201cholding space\u201d refers to a trend for fans to post lyrics from the song online and reflect on their meaning.) What seems to have been missed by other commentators, however, is the role of such social media accounts in pushing the clip, one of hundreds in a packed press tour, to mainstream attention. These are familiar tricks in Trumpworld. Back in 2022, it was reported that the Daily Wire website, led by Ben Shapiro, had spent between $35,000 and $47,000 promoting misleading video clips and news articles attacking Amber Heard, during her defamation battle with her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. The clear intention was to warn young men that the 21st century had become hostile terrain thanks to the excesses of feminism: Trump is the political solution to this problem. End Wokeness and Defying L\u2019s are part of Shapiro\u2019s shared ecosystem. The open-source analyst Ryan McBeth has alleged that the former account is run by the alt-right activist Jack Posobiec, whom the Southern Poverty Law Centre categorises as an extremist with alleged neo-Nazi connections. Related accounts amplified recent attacks on the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast in Disney\u2019s remake of the Little Mermaid, and Colombian-Polish actress Rachel Zegler when cast in Snow White. British commentators jumping on the anti-woke bandwagon likely have no idea that they\u2019re doing the work of far-right disinformation specialists. Nor have members of the cast of Wicked helped themselves by gushing through an overexposed press tour. But our culture sphere needs to wake up to the fact that our responses to major movie events are increasingly being shaped by a white supremacist media operating out of Texas \u2013 or, in this case, Macedonia. Hollywood studios would do well to call out this misinformation when they see it. Their other option is to cater exclusively to one side or other of the political divide. That would prove bad for business and bad for the rest of us. \u2022 Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and culture Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "headline": "Glicked double bill may not match Barbenheimer buzz, experts say",
        "trailText": "Gladiator II and Wicked getting people into theatres but unlikely to replicate phenomenon of Barbie-Oppenheimer release",
        "bodyText": "The great Barbenheimer clash of summer 2023 \u2013 when Barbie came out on the same day as Oppenheimer \u2013 will for ever be a part of cinema history for capturing the public imagination and bringing audiences back to cinemas in droves after years of Covid-induced antipathy. So it\u2019s unsurprising, that in an attempt to recapture some of the excitement, fans have come up with a new portmanteau: Glicked, used to refer to the face-off between Gladiator II and Wicked this week. Ridley Scott\u2019s quarter-century-in-the-making sequel to his 2000 Oscar winner, and Jon M Chu\u2019s adaptation of the beloved stage musical have been released a week apart in the UK and on the same day in the US. And it is hoped the competition will inspire audiences to grab their popcorn for both \u2013 sometimes even in back to back screenings. \u201cIf it has a similar effect to what it did for Barbie and Oppenheimer, it would be amazing,\u201d Paul Mescal, who stars as Lucius in Gladiator II, told Entertainment Tonight. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who co-star as Elphaba and Glinda in Wicked, were also both on board with the concept, with Erivo saying: \u201cGlicked is what it is and that is what we should be doing.\u201d Meanwhile, memes on social media have jumped on the mashup. The artist Eqarti posted a poster placing Mescal\u2019s Gladiator next to Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, as they head toward Oz, with the caption: \u201cgoodbye barbenheimer, it\u2019s time for glicked\u201d. Another meme placed Lucius and Glinda in the same pose as Michelangelo\u2019s Creation of Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. \u201cThe so-called Glicked movie mashup is reminiscent of the Barbenheimer phenomenon and is definitely creating a cultural buzz,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \u201cThough it\u2019s not quite at the Barbenheimer level, it has certainly raised the profile of both films.\u201d Sam Glynne, head of EMEA entertainment and culture marketing at UTA, said what Barbie, Oppenheimer, Gladiator II and Wicked had in common was \u201ca fearless take on visceral storytelling, elevated by smart marketing and social and PR campaigns that captivate audiences from all angles before they\u2019ve even ordered their popcorn.\u201d But according to Tim Richards, CEO of Vue cinemas, there hasn\u2019t been much evidence of people booking double bills like they did for Barbenheimer. \u201cPeople are, however, booking both movies pretty extensibly right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe word of mouth has been very strong, and all social media has been on fire.\u201d The opening weekend for Gladiator II in UK and Ireland was \u00a39.1m \u2013 the biggest opening for a Scott picture. The film entered the international box office last week with $87m, marking the biggest international R-rated opening weekend for Paramount Pictures as well as the best overseas debut for Scott, whose highest-grossing films include The Martian ($630m globally) and Gladiator ($465m globally). \u201cWicked is also going to be absolutely extraordinary,\u201d Richards said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sold almost a quarter of a million tickets before a single screening \u2013 that\u2019s more pre-sales than Barbie. They\u2019re talking of an opening weekend of somewhere between $160m and $200m.\u201d But, despite the enthusiasm, some fans are becoming wary of the constant attempts to reinvent Barbenheimer (there was talk of Saw Patrol last year, and Gladdington as recently as last week). One TikTok user said: \u201cThere will never be another barbenheimer.\u201d Another person posted on X: \u201cstop trying to make glicked happen.\u201d David Hancock, a media and entertainment analyst at Omdia, agreed that Glicked was entirely manufactured. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a double bill. Gladdington was also tried, and didn\u2019t set alight, because it seemed forced and derivative.\u201d The reason Barbenheimer took off, Hancok added, was because it came together organically. \u201cIt was a particular moment [in the recovery of cinema], at a particular time [summer] with particular films [they both were original scripts].\u201d Similarly, Phil Clapp, CEO of the UK Cinema Association, said he would \u201chesitate to draw too many parallels with the almost unique set of circumstances\u201d around Barbenheimer. Clapp said what was actually happening right now was \u201csomething like a return to the normal pattern of major releases we saw pre-pandemic and pre- Hollywood strikes.\u201d The successive release of Paddington in Peru, Gladiator 2, Wicked, and Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King later this month, was \u201ca hugely welcome fillip\u201d for cinemas after a prolonged period of restricted releases. Richards also emphasised that the standout story of this season was a return to the pre-pandemic market of film releases. Whether Glicked is a thing or not, he said, there was a huge buzz and fans were flocking to theatres \u2013 which was a good thing. \u201cIt reinforces the fact that audiences are there, and we just need movies that bring them to theatres. Suddenly we\u2019re very good value for an evening out because people are having an amazing time and want to come back.\u201d",

An artist who had previously seemed hell-bent on singlehandedly dragging pop music into a more interesting, experimental space by sheer force of will \u2013 on her acclaimed 2017 mixtape Pop 2, she collaborated with Estonian \u201cpost-Soviet\u201d rappers, Brazilian drag queens and the extravagantly foul-mouthed underground artist CupcakKe \u2013 had apparently decided not to bother any more. She gamely presented Crash as another experiment in \u201cmaking a major-label album the way it\u2019s actually done\u201d and knowingly embracing \u201ceverything that the life of a pop figurehead has to offer in today\u2019s world \u2013 celebrity, obsession and global hits\u201d, but you somehow sensed her heart wasn\u2019t quite in it. Moreover, it didn\u2019t totally work \u2013 it was well reviewed and became Charli\u2019s first UK No 1 album, but didn\u2019t exactly produce \u201cglobal hits\u201d. What Charli subsequently described as a deadening experience lit a fire under its author: if playing the game was no fun, then why not do exactly as you please? Certainly, Charli xcx\u2019s sixth album turned out to be everything Crash wasn\u2019t, up to and including the defining pop album of the year. Instead of a sleeve featuring the singer in a bikini, as Crash did, Brat came wrapped in a blunt, lowercase rendering of the album\u2019s title against a sickly lime green: intended as a snub to the \u201cmisogynistic and boring\u201d assumption that a female artist should automatically appear on her own album cover, it turned out to be a masterstroke of branding far more pervasive than any glossy photo, even influencing the US presidential race. Its sound was brash and aggressive, early 00s London club music \u2013 electroclash, acid-y bloghouse, dubstep, maximalist rave synths \u2013 shot through a chattering, trebly hyperpop filter: \u201cClub classic but I still pop,\u201d as Von Dutch put it. It oozed self-possession and confidence, Brat seemed to swagger even as Charli confessed to insecurity or inadequacy, a cocktail of emotions that seemed to be at the album\u2019s centre: if everyone feels like this, you might as well own it. It felt fundamentally honest: instead of pop\u2019s usual broad-brushstroke self-help platitudes, there was something striking about the splurge of complex, vacillating feelings regarding motherhood on I Think About It All the Time, or the mixture of admiration and resentment on Mean Girls. Most importantly, it had a surfeit of fantastic songs: Apple, Everything Is Romantic, Club Classics, So I\u2019s heartbreaking eulogy to her late collaborator Sophie. Messy, obdurate and in your face, Brat\u2019s tone struck a genuine cultural nerve. Perhaps you could have seen that coming. Over the last couple of years, a nostalgic fascination with \u201cindie sleaze\u201d \u2013 grimy, sweaty looking images of early 00s hedonism and the music that soundtracked it \u2013 seemed to indicate a longing among gen Z for a rather less straitened, watchful, self-censoring mood than that of recent years. Brat was the right album at the right time, something that other pop stars \u2013 ordinarily more commercially successful than Charli xcx \u2013 recognised: Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and Lorde all appeared on the remix album Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat, the latter on a version of Girl, So Confusing, a song about Charli xcx\u2019s fraught relationship with \u2026 Lorde. Taylor Swift, meanwhile, was apparently so rattled by Brat\u2019s arrival that she suddenly released six different deluxe editions of her album The Tortured Poets Department in order to keep it from reaching No 1 in the UK. Whether Brat singlehandedly drags pop music into a more interesting, experimental space remains to be seen. But whether you view it as zeitgeist-capturing or zeitgeist-changing feels slightly beside the point. More important is that it does everything you might conceivably want a pop album to do: it\u2019s sharp and smart, funny and moving; it\u2019s experimental and danceable; it has big tunes and depth; it sounds like now. And it\u2019s the product of a pop artist declining to chase trends, and instead just being themselves. There\u2019s a lesson in there somewhere.",

Writing on Instagram, she said: \u201cTrying to get my head around why a convicted felon, rapist, bigot was chosen to lead our country because he\u2019s good for the economy?\u201d She also posted a picture of a cake with the words \u201cFuck Trump\u201d etched in frosting along with the caption: \u201cStuffed my face with this cake last night!\u201d The singer has previously castigated Trump, saying at the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in January 2017, the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that she\u2019d thought \u201can awful lot about blowing up the White House\u201d. After a backlash among Trump supporters, she said: \u201cI do not promote violence and it\u2019s important people hear and understand my speech in its entirety rather than one phrase.\u201d Billie Eilish has also expressed dismay in the wake of Trump\u2019s election. She told a concert audience in Nashville on Wednesday: \u201cA person who is a \u2026 let\u2019s say convicted predator, let\u2019s say that \u2026 someone who hates women so, so deeply is about to be the president of the United States of America.\u201d She made the comments prior to a performance of TV, a 2022 song with lyrics referring to the removal of the federal right to abortion access, a decision made by supreme court justices installed during the Trump presidency: \u201cThe internet\u2019s gone wild watching movie stars on trial / While they\u2019re overturning Roe v Wade.\u201d Eilish added to the audience: \u201cI want you to know that you\u2019re safe with me and you\u2019re protected here and that you are safe in this room.\u201d Trump has not been criminally convicted of rape or predatory behaviour. However, in August 2023, a judge found in a civil claim that it was \u201csubstantially true\u201d that Trump raped journalist E Jean Carroll in an incident in late 1995 or early 1996. In 2022, Carroll had sued Trump for battery and defamation, with a jury finding him liable for sexual abuse. Trump countersued for defamation, but that lawsuit was dismissed. In May, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. He was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, after he recorded reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen \u2013 who had paid hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels following her claims of an affair \u2013 as \u201clegal expenses\u201d. Trump\u2019s sentencing is currently scheduled for 26 November. Other musicians expressing outrage at a second Trump presidency include Jack White, who is suing the Trump campaign over allegedly unauthorised use of the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army. White wrote a screed on Instagram which reads in part: \u201cAmericans chose a known, obvious fascist and now America will get whatever this wannabe dictator wants to enact from here on in.\u201d Ariana Grande, Cardi B and Ethel Cain also lamented the election in its immediate aftermath, along with other entertainment figures such as John Cusack, Viola Davis and Jamie Lee Curtis. \u201cWe wake up and fight,\u201d Curtis wrote. \u201cFight for women and our children and their futures and fight against tyranny, one day at a time. One fight at a time. One protest at a time. That\u2019s what it means to be an American.\u201d",

        "trailText": "The much-anticipated first part of the blockbuster musical adaptation has bewitched audiences worldwide, but there are dark times ahead in the sequel",
        "bodyText": "Despite more than a year of build-up and an exhaustive \u2013 some might say exhausting \u2013 press tour that rivaled a Marvel movie in budget, there were still many people who did not know that Wicked, now the most successful film adaptation of a Broadway musical of all time, is actually one half of a pair. To be fair to those who do not follow the entertainment industry, Universal billed the 2hr 40min film, which opens with Ariana Grande\u2019s Glinda the Good Witch promising to tell the \u201cwhole story\u201d of her long-lost friend Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), as just Wicked, not by its title card, Wicked: Part One. And Jon M Chu\u2019s first act concludes with a wildly cathartic, very CGI-ed rendition of Defying Gravity \u2013 the rare musical tune to transcend theater-kid fandom and probably the one thing non-Wicked fans would know about the show. The split, which engendered some skepticism among fans and critics, has not deterred audiences; Wicked made more than $359m in two weekends, smashing a host of musical and holiday-related box office records. The Wicked faithful and newly converted \u2013 my screening was full of young girls born long after the musical premiered in 2003 \u2013 will not have to wait too long to see how Elphaba and Glinda end up on opposite sides of the East/West, Good/Wicked divide. Wicked: Part Two is slated for 21 November 2025, a day short of a year after Part One premiered. This is not a Dune situation, where Part Two was greenlit only after a misleadingly titled Part One proved its mettle at the box office; both Wickeds were filmed together over five months on soundstages in the UK (plus an extra 10 days earlier this year, owing to the Hollywood strikes), ensuring that the cast \u2013 also including Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Bowen Yang, Jonathan Bailey and Ethan Slater \u2013 will remain intact for both parts. Part One, written by Winnie Holzman (who wrote the book for the musical) and Dana Fox, hewed closely to the original stage version, not cutting any songs and expanding some scenes. Part Two, which picks up after the stage version\u2019s intermission, was also adapted by Holzman and Fox, and thus will probably also mirror the leaner, darker second act of the musical. (It\u2019s been 21 years of Wicked on Broadway, but spoilers ahead \u2026 ) While part one functions mostly as prequel, taking place before a misunderstood Elphaba becomes the Wicked Witch of the West, Part Two is more revisionist fable, playing out in parallel to the events of L Frank Baum\u2019s 1900 novel and the classic 1939 film adaptation. Elphaba exits the Emerald City in both exile and triumph, having summoned her full powers and learned the hideous truth of the Wizard\u2019s (Jeff Goldblum) and Madame Morrible\u2019s (Michelle Yeoh) embrace of fascism at the expense of vulnerable scapegoats. (The musical, at turns saccharine and impassioned, is not subtle on the politics, and neither is Chu\u2019s movie). Part Two, assuming Chu once again remains faithful to the musical\u2019s plot (itself loosely based on the novel by Gregory Maguire), picks up some time later, when Something Bad has fully manifested in Oz, with a much swifter timeline as well as origin stories for the Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow. \u201cIf Part 1 is about choices, Part 2 is about consequences,\u201d Chu told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cChoices are difficult to make, but when you do make those choices, sometimes the result isn\u2019t what you expect it to be. It can be lonely, it can be hard.\u201d And those choices have become \u201ceight times more relevant\u201d in the context of recent political and social events, Chu teased to Variety, calling Part Two, at least thematically, a \u201cdoozy\u201d. Despite the resonantly dark material, Chu has assured that Part Two will keep some of the first part\u2019s levity, as best embodied by the buoyant, near-confectionary presence of Grande. \u201cThere is lots of lightness in the movie,\u201d he told EW. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fun parts. We\u2019ve not forgotten about that, but there\u2019s a matureness and a nuance to it that we earn from the first movie.\u201d One of the musical\u2019s weaknesses was that its second act lacked the musical firepower of its first, which contained not only Defying Gravity but theater-kid karaoke staples such as Popular, Dancing Through Life and The Wizard and I. Act two has For Good, arguably the show\u2019s best duet, as well as a few reprisals. Chu seems to have anticipated the need for balance; Stephen Schwartz confirmed that Part Two will include two new songs. There are other anticipated areas of expansion. Part One included a shot from behind of Dorothy and her ragtag crew, and the trailer included an as-yet unused shot of them before the Wizard, suggesting screen time for characters who are not seen in the stage version. (Chu, for his part, has said: \u201cThere is interaction and some crossover.\u201d) Another teaser image shows Glinda in what appears to be a wedding gown, a development outside the scope of the original show. And while Part One contained the bulk of significant cameos \u2013 including original stars Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, as well as Schwartz (as an Emerald City guard) and Holzman (as a member of an acting troupe) \u2013 Part Two will likely contain at least a few names for Broadway and West End fans to spot. Given the extensive promotion for Part One, I assume we will have answers to some questions (and cameos) before next Thanksgiving. But only time will tell whether Part Two can cast as strong a box office spell as the dubiously marketed Part One.",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight. I don\u2019t think she hates to say it at all. LS",
