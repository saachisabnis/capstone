        "bodyText": "Kendrick Lamar has released a surprise album called GNX. The Pulitzer prize-winning rapper teased the release with a one-minute video before the 12-track album was then released. Lamar\u2019s sixth studio album features multiple appearances from SZA as well as Kamasi Washington and a producer credit for Jack Antonoff on all but one song. Earlier this week, DJ Snake had claimed that Taylor Swift would appear on the album as well. It caps off a banner year that saw the rapper release a number of songs attacking Drake, hits that led to him nabbing seven Grammy nominations. He achieved major chart hits with Not Like Us and Like That. The new album doesn\u2019t feature any of the songs from earlier this year but does contain the track Heart Pt 6, after Drake released The Heart Part 6 in May, a diss track aimed at Lamar\u2019s ongoing song series. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m an angry person,\u201d Lamar said earlier this year in an interview. \u201cBut I do believe in love and war, and I believe they both need to exist. And my awareness of that allows me to react to things but not identify with them as who I am. Just allowing them to exist and allowing them to flow through me. That\u2019s what I believe.\u201d Lamar is also set to be the half-time performer at next year\u2019s Super Bowl. It\u2019s a headline gig that\u2019s referenced on Wacced Out Murals, a song on the new album. He raps that Nas had been the \u201conly one\u201d who congratulated him and that his \u201chard work let Lil\u2019 Wayne down\u201d. \u201cRap music is still the most impactful genre to date,\u201d Lamar said in a statement at the time. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.\u201d His last album, 2022\u2019s Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers, was named best rap album at the Grammys. He also became the first non-classical or jazz artist to win the Pulitzer prize for music for his 2017 album Damn.",

        "headline": "Drake files defamation lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar diss track",
        "trailText": "Drake is bringing legal action against Universal Music Group as a result of Lamar\u2019s track Not Like Us, a decision the company calls \u2018illogical\u2019",
        "bodyText": "Drake has filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG), the record label he and rival Kendrick Lamar share, over the latter artist\u2019s diss track Not Like Us. The lawsuit, filed in a New York federal court on Wednesday, comes shortly after the Canadian rapper born Aubrey Drake Graham withdrew a legal challenge he made against UMG and Spotify, alleging they artificially inflated the popularity of Lamar\u2019s track. UMG has responded by calling it \u201cillogical\u201d. That filing \u2013 not a lawsuit, but a petition for documents in preparation for a potential lawsuit filing \u2013 accused UMG and Spotify of trying to \u201cmanipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves\u201d. Lawyers for the rapper had claimed that UMG paid influencers and radio stations to play the track, Not Like Us, which topped the US charts and proved to be the hammer blow in the Drake-Lamar feud between March and May last year. The new defamation suit accuses UMG of defamation and harassment, calling the release and promotion of Lamar\u2019s hit track, with lyrics labeling Drake a \u201ccertified pedophile\u201d, an example of valuing \u201ccorporate greed over the safety and wellbeing of its artists\u201d. The suit alleges that UMG \u201capproved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track\u201d that was \u201cintended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\u201d. Noting that the track\u2019s artwork featured a picture of Drake\u2019s house with markers meant to identify the homes of registered sex offenders, the suit refers to a shooting that occurred outside the residence days after the track\u2019s release, injuring a security guard. It refers to this incident, as well as two attempted trespassings in the subsequent days, as \u201cthe 2024 equivalent of Pizzagate\u201d. Though the suit is primarily concerned with Lamar\u2019s song, it places the blame on UMG for distributing and marketing the track. \u201cThis lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\u201d the filing reads. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d Later on Wednesday, UMG issued a strong-worded response. \u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2013 let alone Drake \u2013 is illogical,\u201d a company spokesperson said in a statement to Variety. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d The statement continues: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music.\u201d Drake is represented in this case by Michael J Gottlieb, a lawyer who has previously represented the owner of a Washington DC pizzeria targeted by \u201cPizzagate\u201d pedophilia conspiracy theorists in 2016, as well as election workers falsely accused by Rudy Giuliani of aiding a fictional plot to steal the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden. In the November filing, Drake alleged that UMG used bots to stream Not Like Us on Spotify in huge numbers, \u201cand deceive consumers into believing the song was more popular than it was in reality\u201d. UMG was accused of paying Apple \u201cto have its voice-activated digital assistant, Siri, purposely misdirect users to Not Like Us\u201d and had \u201cbeen taking steps in an apparent effort to conceal its schemes, including, but not limited to, by terminating employees associated with or perceived as having loyalty to Drake\u201d. Both Drake and Lamar release music through UMG, Drake via Republic Records and Lamar via Interscope. UMG, which called the allegations \u201ccontrived and absurd\u201d said: \u201cThe suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.\u201d Spotify also denied the allegations, saying: \u201cSpotify has no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake\u2019s tracks.\u201d In New York court documents seen by the Guardian, Drake withdrew that request, with the document reading: \u201cPetitioner hereby voluntarily discontinues this special proceeding as to all respondents without costs to any party.\u201d Drake previously filed another petition in Texas, alleging UMG paid the radio group iHeartRadio to play Not Like Us, and that UMG allowed the release of the track despite knowing it contained accusations of Drake being a \u201ccertified paedophile\u201d, which Drake denied. That petition remains active. After numerous diss tracks from each rapper, Lamar was generally considered the winner. Not Like Us, which also alleged Drake was a \u201ccoloniser\u201d leeching off the hip-hop scene, scored the highest single-day and week-long streams of any rap song on Spotify. Drake has released relatively little music after the feud: four tracks in August, plus two appearances on Camila Cabello\u2019s album and another with Mexican-American group Fuerza Regida. But he returned to solo material earlier this month with the freestyle Fighting Irish, which looked back on the Lamar feud and friendships lost over it. \u201cThe world fell in love with the gimmicks, even my brothers got tickets / Seemed like they loved every minute / Just know this shit is personal to us, and it wasn\u2019t just business \u2026 I was sadly mistaken, the loyalty wasn\u2019t a given\u201d, he rapped. He also referred to the \u201ccoloniser\u201d accusation, rapping \u201cI\u2019m starin\u2019 at my daddy\u201d \u2013 Drake\u2019s father is African American.",

Lamar ropes in just three famous pals \u2013 SZA, Kamasi Washington and, notably, ubiquitous pop producer Jack Antonoff \u2013 preferring to showcase new guest rappers on a 12-track bout of amply backed-up grandstanding. While some bewailed this year\u2019s major Drake beef as undignified, most agree that Lamar won, earning assorted Grammy nominations for his track Not Like Us. He managed to broker a Bloods/Crips gang truce to boot. Tracks such as the minimal yet swaggering Man at the Garden thoughtfully detail exactly how Lamar deserves all his accolades and material rewards, while the brilliant, wide-ranging Reincarnated finds him in an imaginary conversation with his father (really, his Father), referencing past musicians\u2019 drug habits, Lamar\u2019s recent history (\u201cI put 100 hoods on one stage\u201d) and using one\u2019s gifts for good. GNX\u2019s pop bent and self-assurance recalls 2017\u2019s Damn more than his jazz magnum opus To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), but the album\u2019s mariachi-singer interludes and the nostalgic exegesis of Heart Pt 6 add up to another unmissable Lamar outing.",

        "trailText": "Drake is understandably vexed about lyrics framing him as a \u2018certified paedophile\u2019 \u2013 but diss tracks are a deliberately lurid part of rap",
        "bodyText": "There were people who thought Drake v Kendrick was the greatest hip-hop beef of all time, attracting a wider level of public interest and proceeding at a more dizzying velocity than any previous feud: the parties involved released 10 tracks in the space of six weeks, more if you count J Cole\u2019s withdrawn 7 Minute Drill and producer Metro Boomin\u2019s BBL Drizzy, released as a contest to see which member of the public could add the best insult of Drake to the instrumental beat. On the other hand, there were high-profile naysayers, among them rapper Macklemore, who complained that the feud was distracting attention from the war in Palestine; and Roots drummer, DJ and hip-hop historian Ahmir \u2018Questlove\u2019 Thompson, who called it \u201cwrestling match level mudslinging and takedown by any means necessary\u201d for an \u201caudience wanting blood [that] will soon put up RIP posts like they weren\u2019t part of the problem\u201d: proof, he suggested, that \u201chip-hop is truly dead\u201d. But there was little debate about who won the battle: it wasn\u2019t just that Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us landed a series of blows on Drake that genuinely seem to have damaged his reputation, it was the sheer scale of its success. No other diss track in history has ever gone to No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100; unequivocally the biggest hip-hop single of 2024, Not Like Us has been nominated for five Grammys. Drake released a response called The Heart Part 6 the day after Not Like Us appeared, and the reaction was so negative that Drake quietly deleted an Instagram post promoting it. And that, one might reasonably have assumed, was that, until November of last year, when Drake unexpectedly filed a petition against Universal Music Group \u2013 which releases both Lamar\u2019s music and his own \u2013 and Spotify accusing them of deceptive business practices: they had, he claimed, used bots to stream the song and \u201cdeceive consumers into believing [Not Like Us] was more popular than it was in reality\u201d. The following day, he filed another petition against UMG under Texas law claiming defamation \u2013 Not Like Us had \u201cfalsely\u201d accused him of being a sex offender \u2013 and a payola scheme involving internet radio platform iHeartRadio. UMG and Spotify denied the allegations. Earlier this week, he withdrew the legal petition \u2013 but then filed an actual lawsuit against UMG: Not Like Us, it alleges, was \u201cintended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\u201d and his own label \u201cdecided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetise allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous\u201d. UMG have repeated their denial, calling Drake\u2019s claims \u201cuntrue\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d. The view that these are the petulant actions of a very sore loser has been regularly expressed. That said, you can understand why Drake might feel driven to the defamation suit. The lyrics of Not Like Us alter the title of his 2021 album Certified Lover Boy to \u201ccertified paedophiles\u201d: \u201cI hear you like \u2018em young \u2026 just make sure you hide your little sister from him,\u201d taunts Lamar, presumably in reference to a 2010 video that showed Drake kissing a fan on stage at a show in Denver, shouting \u201cI can\u2019t go to jail yet, man!\u201d when she revealed she was 17 (the legal age of consent in Colorado), then adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should feel guilty or not, but I had fun. I like the way your breasts feel against my chest.\u201d The video made headlines when it resurfaced in 2019, but accusations of sexual impropriety feel even more pointed in the wake of ongoing allegations against Sean Combs \u2013 currently awaiting trial in New York on charges of racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2013 and Jay-Z, who in December was accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl with Combs at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty in 2000 (Jay-Z denied this, and filed both a motion requesting that the accuser identify themselves and a lawsuit against the accuser\u2019s attorney). How Drake\u2019s case will play out is an intriguing question. There aren\u2019t many precedents for a defamation suit based on song lyrics. In 1999, Eminem\u2019s mother, Debbie Mathers, attempted to sue her son for $11m (\u00a36.8m at the time) over lines about her drug use on his album The Slim Shady LP: she was eventually awarded $25,000 (\u00a315,500), and after paying her lawyer was left with just $1,600 (\u00a31,000). In 2005, a case brought by record producer Armen Boladian over lyrics on rapper Warren G\u2019s 2001 track Speed Dreamin\u2019 \u2013 which called him \u201ca disgrace to the species\u201d and a \u201cbig nose motherfucker\u201d, and suggested he should have \u201cfaeces\u201d thrown at him \u2013 was dismissed, with the offending lines judged to be \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d. Both Drake and UMG might note the wording of the judgment: \u201cThere was no specific allegation, such as an act of child abuse, that could be proven.\u201d But \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d is an interesting phrase in the context of Not Like Us. The alleged defamation took place in the midst of a beef involving umpteen diss tracks. Anyone conversant with hip-hop history knows that the world of the diss track is a peculiar kind of space in which outlandish claims and insults are taken as standard fare: they\u2019re spiteful, nasty, obviously intended to be wounding and often clearly untrue. They have their critics, who often worry about the consequences if the abuse spills over into real life, which it clearly has done more than once in the past, occasionally with deadly consequences: \u201cThose were dark times if you were there,\u201d wrote Questlove, a man who found himself literally in the middle of the warring east coast/west coast factions at the 1995 Source Awards, one of the flashpoints of the feud between 2Pac and the Notorious BIG that left both rappers dead. But diss tracks are also an integral part of the genre, almost as old as hip-hop itself. You could, if you were so minded, draw a line connecting Not Like Us to the insults traded by UTFO and Roxanne Shante in 1984\u2019s Roxanne wars, or the row between MC Shan and Boogie Down Productions over hip-hop\u2019s true birthplace in 1986, although it\u2019s hard to do that without also noting that diss tracks have become more pointed in a faintly troubling way in recent years, dragging artists\u2019 families and, increasingly, children into the firing line as a means of scoring points. No one is ever going to hold up Ether, Nas\u2019s 2001 evisceration of Jay-Z, as a model of decorum, but it still feels like it\u2019s made of different stuff to Pusha T\u2019s stakes-raising The Story of Adidon, an all-out 2018 assault on Drake\u2019s personal life and mental health that one critic described as \u201cbringing a gun to a knife fight\u201d. If Drake\u2019s suit is successful, it throws a hand grenade into a whole area of rap culture. Even if you think the said area could do with cooling down a few degrees, the notion of using the courts to do it is a deeply peculiar one at best; the idea that rappers making diss tracks will be forced to mind their manners or face legal consequences feels somehow antithetical to the whole business, and you could easily depict it as a form of censorship. The case comes in the wake of another rap superstar, Young Thug, being put on trial with his lyrics used as supposed evidence against him, which was criticised as an assault on free speech and artistic expression. Many will see Drake\u2019s lawsuit as doing the same \u2013 and against a fellow rapper, no less. It doesn\u2019t take a huge leap of imagination to see Drake being painted as a man who singlehandedly destroyed a longstanding rap tradition that he was perfectly happy to engage in for years \u2013 feuding on tracks with everyone from Kanye West to Meek Mill to Tyga \u2013 because he was bested at it. A victory in court could turn out to be pyrrhic.",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar ruled the Grammys during a night that also paid tribute to those affected by the California wildfires. The night\u2019s biggest prize, for album of the year, went to Beyonc\u00e9 for Cowboy Carter, the first time she has won the award. It was presented by members of the Los Angeles country fire department in one of many of the night\u2019s tributes to those affected by the wildfires. The ceremony took place at the Crypto.com arena in LA. The singer is only the fourth Black woman to win the award. \u201cIt\u2019s been many many years,\u201d she said to loud applause. A visibly shocked Beyonc\u00e9 also won for best country album, saying she \u201creally was not expecting this\u201d as she accepted the award. \u201cSometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists and I just want to encourage people to do what they\u2019re passionate about,\u201d she said. She was given the award by Taylor Swift. \u201cI will never forget standing here almost exactly 15 years ago,\u201d she said while looking back on her win in this category. Beyonc\u00e9, who also won for best country duo performance with Miley Cyrus, became the first Black woman to win a country Grammy for 50 years. Chris Stapleton took home the award for best country solo performance. Lamar won five awards for his controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us, which is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit. He took home both song and record of the year. During one of his speeches, Lamar, who is performing at next week\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, said he wanted to \u201cdedicate this one to the city\u201d. After last year saw Taylor Swift, SZA, Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish dominate, this year saw another strong female showing with Beyonc\u00e9, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Doechii and Chappell Roan winning many of the major awards. In the competitive best new artist category, Chappell Roan beat out Shaboozey, Raye, Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter. She used her speech to call on the industry to \u201coffer a livable wage and healthcare especially to emerging artists\u201d before telling the story of how she struggled to survive in her early days as a musician. \u201cLabels, we got you but do you got us?\u201d she asked. Charli xcx picked up three awards in the pop categories but lost out on pop solo performance and pop vocal album to Sabrina Carpenter. Doechii won for best rap album, becoming only the third woman to do so. Other female winners included SZA who picked up best R&amp;B song for Saturn, St Vincent who took home best alternative music album, best rock song and best alternative music performance, Kacey Musgraves who picked up best country song for The Architect and Shakira who won best Latin pop album. The Colombian singer dedicated her award to \u201call my immigrant brothers and sisters\u201d. Jimmy Carter was also a posthumous winner for the audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Chris Brown were controversial picks for comedy album and R&amp;B album respectively. Host Trevor Noah began the night by referring to the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances that have changed the tone and motivation of this year\u2019s awards. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest national disasters in American history,\u201d he said while speaking about the devastating California wildfires and calling attention to the spirit of those who have endured. To kick off the show, he introduced Dawes, a band who have lost homes and instruments as a result of the fires. They have also helped raise money for nearly 100 other families. They were joined by artists including John Legend, Sheryl Crow and St Vincent for a special performance paying tribute to Los Angeles. Noah drew attention to a number of charities and organisations, telling those in the room and viewers at home that there would be a QR code which would allow people to contribute. He later said that Amazon Music, CBS and Mastercard had donated. He also said the night would highlight local businesses affected by the fires with the venue both catered and decorated by some and with a certain amount of advertising space given to others. While presenting the award for song of the year, Diana Ross said: \u201cMay this moment remind us all of the power we hold to rebuild, to lift and to come together with compassion.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars performed a duet of California Dreamin\u2019 after a montage highlighting Californians who had lost their homes in the fires. The pair later won the best pop duo performance award for their song Die with a Smile. In her acceptance speech, she said: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d Noah had a number of jabs at the returning US president, joking that millions of immigrants were also part of this year\u2019s voting body. When speaking about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s just-announced tour, he joked: \u201cThere\u2019s tariffs, we can\u2019t afford a new tour! Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Alicia Keys was given the Dr Dre global impact award and spoke to the importance of diversity in music. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry,\u201d she said. She also added that \u201cthis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices\u201d and that \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift\u201d. Other performances throughout the night included Billie Eilish who ended her performance saying \u201cI love LA\u201d, Sabrina Carpenter who sang a rejigged and physically comedic take on her hits Espresso and Please Please Please, Chappell Roan who was introduced by Olivia Rodrigo (the Vampire singer called her \u201cmy extraordinary friend\u201d) and a surprise appearance from the Weeknd who had previously pledged a permanent boycott of the Grammys. His performance was introduced by the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who spoke about the many structural changes he had helped implement which then lured the Weeknd back. There was also a star-studded tribute to Quincy Jones who died last year. Will Smith, making his first appearance on a major televised awards ceremony since the infamous slap, called Jones \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our time\u201d in an introduction to a performance that featured Janelle Monae, Herbie Hancock, Cynthia Erivo and Stevie Wonder, who led a rendition of We Are the World with a choir wearing special LA sweaters. Smith explained that the singers represented two schools that had been lost in the fires. Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin also sang an accompaniment to this year\u2019s in memoriam section which included late stars including Liam Payne, Kris Kristofferson, Cissy Houston, Marianne Faithfull, Bob Newhart, Wayne Osmond and S\u00e9rgio Mendes. Last year saw Taylor Swift become the first artist to win album of the year four times but tonight she went home empty-handed despite six nominations.

        "headline": "Uniqlo\u2019s Kendrick Lamar coup is part of effort to be a serious fashion force",
        "trailText": "Super Bowl appearance continues the retailer\u2019s vibe shift from slightly boring staples into a raved-about brand",
        "bodyText": "Almost a week on from the Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s half-time performance is still being talked about. In particular, the pair of boot-cut jeans worn by the American rapper as he commanded the stage. But while those came from the luxury fashion brand Celine and cost \u00a3830, the scores of backup dancers surrounding him wore a high street label \u2013 to be precise, \u00a319.90 oversized T-shirts and long-sleeved tops from Uniqlo. It is another big coup for the Japanese-founded retailer that has steadily grown its presence on the British high street with 20 stores and counting. For a brand previously seen as a little boring, all beige and greige logoless casual wear, it is quite the vibe shift. It now infiltrates the wardrobes of everyone from gen Z youngsters who love its cargo joggers and cult crossbody bag, to their grandparents who rave about its Heattech thermals and affordable cashmere jumpers. Now it has its sights set on winning over the fashion world. Last September, Uniqlo cemented its status as a serious player when Clare Waight Keller became its creative director. The British designer previously held stints at Calvin Klein and Chlo\u00e9 and during her three years as artistic director at the French fashion house Givenchy designed the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s wedding dress. The fact that a high street retailer had persuaded one of luxury\u2019s most influential fashion designers to decamp from a world of catwalk shows and celebrity-fronted campaigns speaks volumes about Uniqlo\u2019s sway. It also points to a changing definition of what luxury means. Waight Keller says part of the lure of Uniqlo is that it appeals to everyone. \u201cWe have to remember there are a lot of people who don\u2019t have a lot of money. As much as they aspire to buy luxury, it\u2019s not realistic for everyone to afford it. I have a mission in me to bring the quality of design that you would get from luxury to a broader audience. I think everybody deserves to wear something beautiful.\u201d Uniqlo\u2019s appeal has not always been so widespread in the UK. Founded in Hiroshima in 1984, it ended up closing 16 of its stores within 18 months of first launching on the British high street in 2001 due to poor footfall. Although it has tried to distance itself from fast fashion claiming it does not chase trends and offering in-store repair and recycling, Uniqlo still produces a staggering 60m items annually. On the ethical fashion Good On You app it scores a \u201cit\u2019s a start\u201d \u2013 the same rating as H&amp;M. Two decades after its UK launch, Uniqlo has found its stride. Its \u00a369.90 down jackets are a fraction of the cost of a \u00a3360 North Face puffer while its limited-edition collaborations with designers including Loewe\u2019s Jonathan Anderson sell out within minutes. Joy Montgomery, the commerce editor at British Vogue, says the fact it \u201cdelivers on form and function without breaking the bank\u201d sets it apart from other high street stores. \u201cSometimes we just want a staple that comes in five colourways and has a handy pocket for our AirPods.\u201d Nearly six months into her creative director role, which includes overseeing Uniqlo\u2019s mainline and Uniqlo:C, a capsule collection of elevated pieces, the Waight Keller effect is beginning to trickle down into stores. She has expanded the colour palette by introducing sharp citrus shades and romantic pinks to its cashmere and linen ranges. Timelessness is important. The T-shirts worn by Lamar\u2019s dancers launched seven years ago. Waight Keller still wears clothes she bought from the brand 15 years ago. To maintain relevancy she is focused on proportions and fine-tuning silhouettes. A \u201ctrack suit\u201d consists of trackpants and a blazer. Tops and dresses come with in-built bras while shorter skirts include built-in shorts. Waight Keller is particularly pleased with a crepe jersey dress with spaghetti straps and a cutout back detail that does not require a bra. \u201cIn the summer women can feel uncomfortable in the heat,\u201d Waight Keller says. \u201cI wanted to eliminate that. You don\u2019t need to find things that work together. You can just put one thing on.\u201d It is this type of pragmatic approach that is sure to win over fashion shoppers lamenting the lack of female-led luxury houses. As for It bags, following the success of her pocketed tote bag that can fit a laptop and sold out in 10 minutes upon launch, there is another \u00a324.90 version on its way with even more pockets. This function-first approach partly comes from Waight Keller\u2019s inspiration \u2013 people-watching at airports. \u201cThere is no fixed demographic. So functionality and simplicity are key. There is a purist approach that is rooted in Japanese culture. Everything has a reason. There is nothing superfluous.\u201d Uniqlo essentials Round mini shoulder bag, \u00a314.90 Deceptively small looking, this can fit everything from your phone to a rotisserie chicken. Cotton crew neck T-shirt, \u00a319.90 Features a special AIRism fabric to keep wearers, including Super Bowl dancers, cool. Ribbed crop sleeveless top, \u00a319.90 Beloved by gen Z thanks to its in-built bra and cropped style Heattech cashmere top, \u00a319.90 The secret layer worn by editors during winter fashion weeks. Crepe jersey dress, \u00a334.90 A cutout backless dress with in-built moulded bra and a supportive side panel. Genius. Launching in March. Tailored blazer, \u00a369.90 A Giorgio Armani-inspired relaxed suit for a snippet of a luxury price tag. Launching late February.",

        "headline": "Kendrick Lamar to hit Super Bowl stage as Taylor Swift and Trump set to attend",
        "trailText": "Grammy-winning rapper will bring controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us to US\u2019s biggest TV audience of the year",
        "bodyText": "Kendrick Lamar is preparing to go from Grammys glory to the Super Bowl half-time show as the biggest US sporting event of the year arrives in New Orleans this weekend. The acclaimed rapper won five Grammy awards last weekend for his controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us. The song is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit with lyrics calling the Canadian star a \u201ccertified paedophile\u201d. Drake\u2019s lawyers have called the song \u201cdangerous\u201d in a filing made last month. According to TMZ, Lamar will definitely be including the song in his performance but the question remains as to which lyrics will be deemed suitable for the telecast by both the NFL and Fox, who will be airing the game. Lamar is no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having appeared during 2022\u2019s hip-hop and R&amp;B headliner show alongside Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J Blige. In an interview this week, he spoke of the importance of bringing his \u201cLA energy\u201d with him on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s something I wanted to carry over to New Orleans and for the world to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is me. This is Kendrick Lamar, 37 years old, and I still feel like I\u2019m elevating, I\u2019m still on a journey.\u201d When asked about what viewers can expect, he said that \u201cstorytelling\u201d will be a key component of his set. Speculation has been rife over who his surprise guests will be, with only SZA as yet confirmed. The pair recently announced a major arena tour starting later this year. \u201cWhat I can say is he\u2019s worked really hard on it,\u201d SZA said at the Grammys. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so honored to be a part of it and I\u2019m so honored to even know him and exist in the same time as someone as brilliant as him.\u201d Taylor Swift is set to attend again in support of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, whose team, the Kansas City Chiefs, will face the Philadelphia Eagles. Swift, who previously collaborated with Lamar on the single Bad Blood, will reportedly watch the game from a $2m suite at the Caesars Superdome with rumours of celebrity friends alongside. Last year she brought Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, Ice Spice, Lana Del Rey and Ryan Reynolds with her. The singer will face her own competition within the stadium with Donald Trump set to attend, the first time a sitting president has watched the game in person. After Swift showed her support for the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, last year, Trump posted online: \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\u201d In a 2019 interview with the Guardian, Swift said: \u201cWe\u2019re a democracy \u2013 at least, we\u2019re supposed to be \u2013 where you\u2019re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate. I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy.\u201d When Kelce was asked about Trump\u2019s attendance this week he said: \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s a great honor. I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I\u2019m excited because it\u2019s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there \u2013 it\u2019s the best country in the world \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d The cost of a Super Bowl ad has also risen this year to $8m for a 30-second spot. Major commercials this year will include stars such as Ben Affleck, Charli xcx, Matthew McConaughey, Glen Powell, Greta Gerwig and a reunion for the When Harry Met Sally stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal. The Hollywood Reporter is claiming through sources that many big stars are receiving $3-5m for leading ads. One of the most controversial spots on Sunday may come from the divisive artificial intelligence company OpenAI. It will mark the first foray into commercial advertising for the firm behind ChatGPT. Google has already been forced to edit an ad for its AI tool after it included a false statistic about global gouda consumption, a mistake that was blamed on AI itself. Last year\u2019s Super Bowl attracted about 123 million viewers.",

        "trailText": "While the game goes ahead, it\u2019s a big night for culture with a much-anticipated half-time show, a string of big name ads and a returning role for Taylor Swift",
        "bodyText": "So Taylor\u2019s boyfriend didn\u2019t win this year, that much we know (Taylor, on the receiving end of some pretty juvenile boos, didn\u2019t seem to have the greatest of nights this time around) but he wasn\u2019t the night\u2019s biggest loser \u2013 that would be Drake. The Canadian rapper has been on the receiving end of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s ridicule for months now, and tonight we got to see the perfect finale, the Grammy-winning diss track Not Like Us performed for America\u2019s biggest TV audience of the year. It was the most obvious crowd-pleasing moment of a mostly unconventional set, avoiding bigger songs and relying on social commentary, via Samuel L Jackson, that challenged an audience accustomed to an easy ride. The ads of the night were starrier than usual, as was the stadium itself, but there was also an unpleasant amount of both AI spots and those that were not exactly political but were patriotic in an old-fashioned way that felt prioritised at the expense of anything more progressive (No gays! No trans! Just one mention of climate change!). It tracked that it was the year that Trump turned up. At least he got to see Kendrick Lamar perform. F1 The big Super Bowl spot for Brad Pitt\u2019s F1, one of the summer\u2019s biggest question marks, continues the good work done by last year\u2019s first trailer, focusing on multi-sense immersion. It\u2019s set to be the most authentic racing film we\u2019ve ever seen, made in collaboration with the governing body behind Formula One and filmed during actual events over the last couple of years, and the stripped-back new ad highlights such authenticity. Hopes are high with a giant budget and backers Apple still waiting for their first genuine box office hit but if anyone can make this kind of unlikely magic happen, it\u2019s Joseph Kosinski, who also steered Top Gun: Maverick from curio to blockbuster. Smurfs In year that\u2019s lazily bringing back more franchises than ever before from Jurassic World to Final Destination to 28 Days Later to How to Train Your Dragon, why not try once again to make Smurfs work? The characters have moved from Sony to Paramount after two connected films and one reboot and all bets have now been placed on Rihanna as Smurfette, following in the footsteps of Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. After all that wait, is the new Rihanna album going to be a Smurfs soundtrack? The next chapter in the story of soda A wildly ambitious ad here from Poppi, that slightly more expensive and substantially less tasty alternative to regular soda. According to the voiceover, Poppi is what what your kids will think of when they think of soda! Poppi is the next chapter in the story of soda! It\u2019s enough to scare one into actually drinking Poppi. Super Bowl ads always lean patriotic \u2013 Budweiser Clydesdales, etc \u2013 but this year had an especially awkward edge. The current political divide is stark, and the president who is currently attempting to dismantle much of the government was in attendance tonight. And yet many of the ads and game promos, starring A-list celebrities such as Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, blithely championed American iconography: freedom, flags, the open range and, of course, football. That\u2019s the job, but especially absent any topics considered \u201cwoke\u201d (Kendrick\u2019s half-time show notwithstanding), the disconnect was striking. Carl\u2019s Jr brings back bikinis Eight years after ditching the strategy of using models in bikinis to sell their burgers, Carl\u2019s Jr returns with TikTok influencer Alix Earle doing just that. Well, tonight was not the romcom sequel for Taylor Swift. You do not need to understand football to know that Travis Kelce\u2019s team didn\u2019t play well. No shots of Taylor cheering during a pivotal moment. The Chiefs, and TNT, were never underdogs, but didn\u2019t even have the semblance of being underdogs this year, and popular sentiment was solidly in favor of the other team. Taylor even got some boos when she appeared on the jumbotron: She did get some support from Serena Williams, though. And she will be fine, of course. Andy Reid\u2019s side hustle Andy Reid, leader of the Kansas City Chiefs, is making a play to fill the void of America\u2019s favorite NFL coach left by \u2026 no one \u2026 with this riff on the side hustle. First it was Zoolander-esque hand-modeling \u2013 the better to show off what three Super Bowl rings you have \u2013 and now it is Skechers no hands slide-ons. Here\u2019s Sam Wolfson\u2019s great four-star review of tonight\u2019s half-time show: Novocaine As audiences prefer to stick with known quantities like Keanu Reeves, Gerard Butler and Jason Statham, Hollywood continues to try out new action stars with mostly middling results. Aaron Taylor-Johnson couldn\u2019t get anyone craving some Kraven the Hunter, Henry Cavill scored two flops back-to-back with Argylle and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, and this weekend, Ke Huy Quan\u2019s first leading vehicle Love Hurts went nowhere for nobody all at once (it opened to a pitiful $5.8m). Will they warm to Ana de Armas in John Wick summer spinoff Ballerina or maybe Jack Quaid, best known for Amazon\u2019s The Boys and last month\u2019s Companion, in gimmicky caper Novocaine? He plays a man incapable of feeling pain whose girlfriend is kidnapped. Given the pricey placement of this new tease, it\u2019s clear that Paramount is hoping for big things from a film that looks like it has a very small budget. All said and done, Kendrick\u2019s \u201cHey Drake\u201d impish grin is definitely the meme of the night. Some highlights from what remains of the site formerly known as Twitter: Cher turns back time for Uber Eats Uber would like you to know that they too know the memes on Cher not aging \u2013 in another budget-flex ad clearly inspired by one of the greatest ever Twitter (never X) threads, Cher uses her powers of timelessness/Uber Eats to turn back time \u2026 to the era of witch trials. Walton Goggins\u2019s AI goggle glasses Walton Goggins is the latest celebrity to hop on the AI endorsement train, for GoDaddy\u2019s Airo, a generative AI service for small businesses. Lol that the ad compares AI\u2019s ability to produce things you don\u2019t know how to make \u2013 like a logo for Walton Goggins\u2019s goggle glasses \u2013 to the skills of \u2026 a human actor. I think you should eat The internet\u2019s favorite IYKYK comedians Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson bring their signature absurd comedy of manners to this Totino\u2019s Pizza Rolls spot that is basically an IYKYK ad for Robinson\u2019s Netflix series I Think You Should Leave. I am personally delighted to see what deranged platitudes they can deliver in under 10 seconds. There\u2019s also some footage of the guy who was tackled and removed during the performance after he rushed onto the field with a Palestine flag: Here\u2019s the full half-time performance if you missed it: Muppets on vacation No one has quite figured out what to do with the Muppets ever since they returned in 2010\u2019s rather wonderful movie. There was a middling sequel, a one-season ABC series and a one-season Disney+ series, the characters currently stuck in Disney\u2019a vault until someone else reboots them. They\u2019ve been let out for a brief appearance in this Booking.com ad, their umpteenth Super Bowl ad that, as has become standard, doesn\u2019t really know what to do with them. Dove goes for body positivity In a spot aiming for serious and sentimental, Dove makes another case for changing the way we talk to girls about their bodies, comparing the joy a three-year-old finds in running to the self-hatred a 14-year-old feels about her legs. No product, just a call to treat girls better, becauseone in two who quit sports are criticized for their bodies. Oof. David Beckham\u2019s long-lost brother? In an ad clearly going for the \u201cmost cinematic\u201d award of the night, David Beckham learns he has a long-lost brother, whom his parents named \u201cOther David\u201d. Enter Matt Damon, playing Other David, and the pair bond over a pint, \u201csoccer\u201d (meaning \u201cfootball\u201d) and requisite Ben Affleck ribbing. In surround sound: Harrison Ford waxes poetic for Jeep Wow, Harrison Ford is really feeling his Yellowstone era (he stars in 1923). The actor appears, mug in hand, in a lodge by the mountains, in stoic main character mode for a video essay on the importance of writing your own story, life\u2019s owner\u2019s manuals and freedom, etc. Some shots of American soldiers and the beautiful Rockies gives an extra layer of weird patriotism to this rambling Jeep ad, one of several weirdly patriotic spots tonight. A serious note for climate change A break from things to buy with a spot on something more pressing: climate change. The ad, from a group from Science Moms and the Potential Energy Coalition, is blunt on the point that we\u2019re running out of time to make necessary changes for the climate, and to give our children the world we promised. The ad apparently only aired in LA and on streaming, but will still presumably reach millions, along with all that AI promo. Is there any celebrity who isn\u2019t there tonight? Apart from Drake ofc: One of the best SNL Super Bowl skits imagined a world where the half-time guest cancelled at the last minute and was replaced by Broadway musical theatre actors. Cue horror: Stop enjoying those mozzarella sticks It\u2019s time to back away from the snacks thanks to a rollercoaster ad here from telehealth company Hims and Hers. First we\u2019re scared \u2013 obesity is a deadly epidemic that kills millions - then we\u2019re angry \u2013 there\u2019s a $160bn industry that profits from urging us to lose weight \u2013 then we\u2019re relieved \u2013 the answer lies with, you got this, Hims and Hers and a range of effective but, wait, still not exactly free medications. Now we\u2019re hungry again. Still hung up on Not Like Us over here, the second of two Drake diss tracks (the other being Euphoria) that Kendrick performed to the largest audience of his career. Interestingly, Kendrick made some adjustments to the lyrics for the broadcast \u2013 he notably skipped over the word \u201cpedophile\u201d (the center of Drake\u2019s defamation lawsuit against UMG), but did get the whole crowd in for \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d. And, well, he said this. Not a good night for Drake: The Bud Light boys are back Bud Light smartly recruited the two most Bud Light-y of celebrities \u2013 longtime rep Post \u201cSolo cup on stage\u201d Malone and comedian Shane \u201chold my beer\u201d Gillis \u2013 for this year\u2019s spot, fittingly set in an archetypical suburban cul-de-sac. The message? Bud Light lets dudes be dudes. Somehow this successfully toes the line between \u201cAmerica, fuck yeah!\u201d and \u201cactually could be fun\u201d. H\u00e4agen-Dazs slows it down Fast and Furious fam Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris slow down thanks to the smooth jams of Smokey Robinson and an ice-cream bar. There are shades of a 2000s-era Viagra commercial thanks to the mood music, Pacific Coast Highway locale and vintage car. Kieran Culkin is baby beluga Kieran Culkin, the former Succession star on the awards circuit this year for playing a very Kieran Culkin character, appears here as a very Kieran Culkin character who is also a financially savvy beluga whale. I think this counts as part of the Oscar campaign? Go away, Doja Cat In a year that\u2019s more stuffed with celebrity ads than usual, a rather funny use here of a rather funny Doja Cat forcing her way into Taco Bell\u2019s celebrity-free Super Bowl ad. Get her on SNL! Jurassic World: Rebirth While the Jurassic World movies might have failed to reach the lofty heights of Jurassic Park, I\u2019d argue they were mostly more successful than the two films that followed it. That, some hard-to-shake nostalgia and the pairing of Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali make it difficult not to get just a bit excited about the still completely unnecessary Jurassic World: Rebirth. The new spot is essentially a remix of the recent trailer but then that was a remix of everything that came before anyway. It appears that someone briefly crashed Kendrick\u2019s performance with a Palestinian flag with the words Sudan and Gaza written on it, even getting on the set\u2019s GNX car. According to Guardian sports editor Bryan Graham, who is at the game, the person waved the flag for about 45 seconds before security guards tackled them. Tipsy on sugar Shaboozey might not have won any Grammy awards for his monster hit Tipsy but he did get the chance to sing It\u2019s a Wonderful World in a Super Bowl ad for Nerds gummy clusters, so every cloud \u2026 Kendrick really will not give Drake a break, even taking a fresh swipe at him during the show. \u201cI want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,\u201d he said during one tease of Not Like Us, referring to Drake\u2019s defamation lawsuit over the track. Even abridged and censored, the song was still an astonishing W for the rap beef. Even rumored former Drake paramour Serena Williams was on stage for the occasion. Naturally, it also lit up the internet. Nate Bargatze balls out for DoorDash Nate Bargatze is on a roll \u2013 after hosting Saturday Night Live for the second time this fall, and thus being one of the more famous standup comics in America, he\u2019s now applying his dry humor to a Super Bowl ad in support of DoorDash\u2019s rewards program. My main question is: where did he get this Met Gala-worthy robe? Matthew McConaughey vouches for good AI Another commercial break, another celebrity vouching for some version of AI \u2013 in this case, Matthew McConaughey gets stranded in the rain because his booking app doesn\u2019t use Salesforce\u2019s AI assistant Agentforce, while Woody Harrelson has a nice dry meal. An attempt to assuage fears with folksiness, as McConaughey assures it\u2019s \u201cwhat AI was meant to be\u201d. Also if Samuel L Jackson turning up wasn\u2019t enough of a surprise\u2026 And here are some closer looks at Kendrick\u2019s show-stopping performance (with guests): Was it just me, or did that show feel like it flew by? Kendrick ends on a high note with a shoutout to Compton and his collaborator, Mustard, for the GNX track tv off. Kendrick and was confident and in command throughout, SZA sounded amazing, the act was a political statement in its existence \u2013 a solid Super Bowl half-time show. Here\u2019s that moment: Oh, he\u2019s really teasing and dragging out the intro to Not Like Us, this must feel good. \u201cThey tried to rig the game but you can\u2019t fake influence,\u201d he says before launching into the hit of last year. Well, it happened. We heard \u201chey Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young\u201d at the Super Bowl, along with tens of thousands trilling \u201cA minorrrrrr\u201d. Kendrick is bouncing between the eras \u2013 Damn, GNX (he teases Not Like Us, but not yet!), then slows it down with SZA for Luther and their Black Panther hit All the Stars. All smooth and mesmerizing so far. Oh hell yeah, Jackson once again appears to mock so many criticisms of rap music \u2013 \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto\u201d \u2013 before Kendrick goes into Humble, with his red, white and blue dancers forming an American flag of Black faces. That\u2019s quite an image. Alright, alright, Kendrick is here. Samuel \u201cUncle Sam\u201d Jackson introduces the one and only Kendrick, who starts a cappella on a GNX before he brings out a team of coordinated dancers and a statement \u2013 \u201cThe revolution about to be televised, you picked the right time but the wrong guy\u201d \u2013 before launching into Squabble UP. Let\u2019s goooooo. OK, we\u2019re minutes away from Kendrick\u2019s half-time show, and we can see behind the commentators that a GNX is now at midfield, the platform is being wiped down, the smoke is billowing, the lights are going down \u2026 almost go time! If there\u2019s any remaining doubt about whether Kendrick\u2019s going to perform Not Like Us in a few minutes: they cranked it up for the crowd while the stage crew set up for his show \u2026 With the statement released, Drake is as far away as possible (Australia) wearing \u2026 this (swipe for the boots): Drake has spoken! Ahead of Kendrick\u2019s half-time performance, in which he will almost certainly sing his Drake diss track to a 100-plus million people, the Canadian rapper released a statement doubling down on his claim of defamation: For reference, Drake has sued his and Kendrick\u2019s label, Universal Music Group \u2013 not Kendrick himself \u2013 accusing the company or prioritizing profits, for a hit song calling him a pedophile, over the truth/his mental health. Welcome to Magic Mike\u2019s Wrexham St\u014dk Cold Brew\u2019s first Super Bowl ad (is this the go-to grocery store coffee now?), invokes the power of franchise brands: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s Wrexham football club and, more entertainingly, Magic Mike. Good to know Channing Tatum\u2019s still game and still got it. Nike convenes the female all-stars This one\u2019s for the girls! Nike recruits a stacked roster \u2013 Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Caitlin Clark and Jordan Chiles, among others \u2013 for a spot roasting all the criticisms people will lob at female athletes. Such as: you can\u2019t be too ambitious, fill a stadium, be too emotional, etc. Some sick shots of Chiles doing gymnastics. Co-signing and cc-ing Hellmann\u2019s: Glen Powell\u2019s pickup truck fairytale Glen Powell, a proud Texan and one of Hollywood\u2019s It boys, appeals to his base: women and men who love trucks (especially the Dodge Ram). Powell is so game for anything that this revisionist fairytale of a man and his three bear-ish trucks is actually pretty charming. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s gig as the half-time show performer arrives at an unprecedentedly great time for the Compton-bred rapper, and a very bad time for Drake. The two stars\u2019 rap beef last year lit up the charts and the culture; last week, Kendrick stomped the nail in the coffin by winning not one but five Grammys for his diss track Not Like Us, a masterpiece of studied hater energy. I will not soon forget the image of Kendrick accepting his song of the year award as the crowd trilled \u201cA minorrrrrr\u201d. It only gets worse for Drake, because it\u2019s likely a stadium full of people will sing that line tonight. There\u2019s almost no way Kendrick, who guested during Dr Dre\u2019s half-time hip-hop bonanza three years ago, will leave the summer smash off the setlist. As for what else to expect \u2026 Collaborator SZA is confirmed to make an appearance. And in a rare interview with Apple Music, Kendrick promised \u201cstorytelling\u201d \u2013 be that on Drake or, more likely, in support of Compton and Black America, we shall have to wait and see. A horse walks into a bar Super Bowl regulars Budweiser here to teach us that every young horse\u2019s childhood dream is to help people drink cheap watery beer. Inspiring! Pringles makes moustaches fly Another ad with flying facial hair? The always welcome Adam Brody sounds the empty Pringles can alarm, accidentally transforming many a famous moustache (Nick Offerman, Andy Reid) into a disconcerting facial hair moth-like thing. When Harry Met Hellman\u2019s A \u201chow have they not done this yet?\u201d moment from Hellman\u2019s, in which Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal revive the famous Katz\u2019s deli scene from When Harry Met Sally. Sydney Sweeney steps in for the role of the \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having\u201d granny. So that reported Open AI ad for ChatGPT has aired \u2013 a simple black and white design in pointillist dots, because \u201call progress has a starting point\u201d. It frames ChatGPT as a tool for human expression, asking \u201cwhat do you want to create next?\u201d Which is \u2026 an interesting framing. Poor Kendrick getting drenched in Gatorade here by one of tonight\u2019s special guests, SZA. Impressive calm: Nestle gets tongues dancing Nestle\u2019s first-time Super Bowl spot for Coffee Mate is a now rare thing: an ad without a celebrity. At least, a visible one \u2013 an off-screen Shania Twain gets saddled with a jingle about a tongue left dancing from allegedly delicious cold foam. Cooking for aliens One of the laziest pick-up-the-cheque-and-run celebrity ads of the night has Gordon Ramsay being told he needs to cook for some foodie aliens before discovering that a) their hi-tech frying pans are in fact HexClad, a brand he already uses, and b) their leader is Pete Davidson. Worse than it sounds! It\u2019s a big day for SZA fans \u2013 earlier today, ahead of her appearance during Kendrick Lamar\u2019s half-time show, she released four new songs off Lana, the deluxe edition of her Grammy-winning album SOS. The new tracks \u2013 Joni (featuring Don Toliver), Take You Down, Open Arms (just SZA) and PSA \u2013 are basically updated version of songs that have been floating around for awhile, but still, a win for SZA fans. As a football game, the Super Bowl has stayed pretty consistent in recent years \u2013 the Chiefs versus someone. As a spectacle of American capitalism, it has ballooned. The price of a 30-second spot this year \u2013 let alone the celebrities featured in them \u2013 surpassed $8m, a new record for America\u2019s most-watched game. Pre-game ads are also busting the bank, going for a reported $4m or so. That\u2019s not the inevitable growth of inflation; just six years ago, the spots were becoming difficult to sell, the attention not seen as entirely worth the price. But the rise of diffuse streaming platforms means the rare opportunity for millions upon millions of eyeballs looking at the same thing at once \u2013 and advertisers are paying for it. Google\u2019s AI goes for the heart The night\u2019s requisite tearjerker, about a man using Google\u2019s Gemini AI voicebot to help him prep for a job interview after years off the market as a stay-at-home dad. One of the lasting images from last week\u2019s Grammys: a prolific hater salutes a fellow prolific hater, as his diss track wins song of the year. The Super Bowl is an almost assured victory lap for infamous grudge holders Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, regardless of the outcome of the game. Issa Rae does her taxes Issa Rae drives backwards down a highway to correctly point out that taxes suck and are unnecessarily confusing \u2013 the solution being TurboTax. She also gets to play \u201cis it cake?\u201d with a box of forms. Celebs celebing together: Uber Eats orders all the celebs Last year, Uber Eats reunited Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer for a Ross and Rachel-themed spot, this time it flexes that celebrity budget again with Matthew McConaughey as a conspiracy theorist who believes that football was invented to sell people food \u2013 with cameos from Kevin Bacon, Charli xcx, Martha Stewart and Greta Gerwig. Only for salty freaks Who new Ritz had such game? The saltiest cracker brand has hired the saltiest of celebrities \u2013 Aubrey Plaza and Michael Shannon \u2013 for their new Super Bowl spot, trying to outdo each other, only to be met with a very smiley Bad Bunny, breaking the rules. One of tonight\u2019s better ideas and smarter use of celebrities. Like presumably half the viewers this evening, we have eyes on Taylor Swift, who is in her private zone with Ice Spice, the Haim sisters and her family: Wearing bedazzled (lol) jean shorts with white leather boots: Making meme-ories already: And a full look at TNT\u2019s fits \u2013 she is at least true to her style with the thigh-high boots, oversized jacket and cut-off denim. Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg say no to hate Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg list reasons people hate \u2013 because you\u2019re from a different neighborhood, look different, act different, are different \u2013 in this spot that calls for people to \u201cstand up to hate\u201d. A nice message, to be sure, though quite hypocritical given that it\u2019s on behalf of the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism \u2013 a group founded by Patriots owner and noted Zionist Robert Kraft, who has blamed protests against Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza, which has killed an estimated 60,000 people, on \u201cdisinformation\u201d and conflated Palestine with Hamas. Coors has a bad case of the Mondays An ad that might make you rethink that last beer from Coors, about sloths at work the day after the Super Bowl, perhaps one of the Monday-ist Mondays of the year. Food Avengers assemble A pretty smart ad here from app Instacart that turns a standard shopping list into a range of characters storming their way to your day. There\u2019s the Jolly Green Giant, the Kool-Aid Man and even a cameo from the shirtless Old Spice guy Isaiah Mustafa, making us all feel guilty for how much of that dip we\u2019ve already eaten. Tripping on Baja Blast Here\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from this Mountain Dew ad: drink enough Baja Blast and you\u2019ll trip so hard you imagine Seal (the singer) as a seal (the marine mammal) crooning the 1995 hit and dentist office standard Kiss from a Rose \u2013 er, lime, in this case. Barry Keoghan\u2019s donkey gets a website In a cute and clever spot that capitalizes on both Irish accents and latent goodwill for all Irish donkeys, Squarespace reunites the two breakout stars of 2022\u2019s The Banshees of Inisherin: Barry Keoghan and Jenny the Donkey (justice for Jenny!). Except Jenny is actually Don Mosley the donkey, seeking a publicist and agent via his new website. A lot of futurist ads and American propaganda already this evening. And fittingly, T-Mobile has backed away from celebrities for a primetime spot touting its partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, which promises to bring satellite connections to all of the cellular dead zones in the US. Likely won\u2019t be the only ad helping out a tech billionaire this evening! Michelob\u2019s Ultra pickleball players My favorite spot of the night so far, because there is no better pair of actors to play to deceptively serious, deviously talented pickleball players than Catherina O\u2019Hara and Willem Dafoe. A delight from start to trophy finish. Thunderbolts Disney also teased its other big summer bet Thunderbolts with a 30-second version of a brand new trailer that\u2019s just been released online. \u201cThe Avengers are not coming\u201d says Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s Wario-ed Nick Fury at the start of the preview for the sorta antiheroes assemble caper (technically not true given that a new Avengers film has been given the green light) before a series of quips, explosions and an ironically used 80s pop song are trotted out to hopefully lure Deadpool fans to their local cinema this May. Meta tries distraction How should Meta distract users from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s cozy embrace of Trump, nixing of DEI programs and factchecking services on the platform, and very weird comments about masculinity? How about a Super Bowl ad for Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses, featuring Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt perusing (and destroying) Kris Jenner\u2019s art collection? Barrymore and Bloom make small talk Drew Barrymore and Orlando Bloom come together, and compare accents (how to say schedule, etc), for MSC Cruises How to Train Your Dragon Maybe one of the least necessary animated-to-live-action transfers we\u2019ve been lumped with for a while, the How to Train Your Dragon spot doesn\u2019t offer anything we didn\u2019t already expect and haven\u2019t already seen before. It feels like the original wasn\u2019t all that long ago and with the dragon looking essentially the same in both, it\u2019s a struggle to know why we\u2019re here again. Eugene Levy loses his eyebrows Little Caesars\u2019s Crazy Puffs are so eyebrow-raising delectable that they cause Eugene Levy\u2019s famously strong brows to fly right off his face like a gray, distinguished moth \u2013 which makes for images more unnerving than appealing. Lilo and Stitch Disney deserves some reluctant credit here for creating a Super Bowl ad that doesn\u2019t just resemble a condensed trailer, turning something eye-rollingly predictable (a live-action Lilo &amp; Stitch) into an advert we're actually surprised by. The 30-second spot has the once-animated, now CG monster invade the pitch, helping to kick off a campaign that will most likely make the most of all Fox and Disney channels in the next few months. Ben Affleck doubles down for Dunkin\u2019 Aaaand the first commercial of the game goes to Ben Affleck, who would like you to forget that last year he did his Dunkin\u2019 spot with one Jennifer Lopez \u2026 but not that he\u2019s forever and always from Boston. This first clip is actually part of a seven-minute short film called DunKings 2, featuring his brother Casey, former Patriots coach Bill Belichick, Belichick\u2019s 24-year-old girlfriend and Jeremy Strong, poking fun at his Serious Actor reputation. And here\u2019s that aforementioned Lady Gaga performance: Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning There are many many restarts this summer \u2013 Final Destination, Fantastic Four, Jurassic World \u2013 but there is one major end. Just don\u2019t tell Tom Cruise. What is now being marketed as the last Mission: Impossible film was once supposed to be the second part of the seventh yet underwhelming box office has changed both title and strategy with Paramount hoping, reportedly against its star\u2019s wishes, to wrap things up. This new spot pushes that selling point hard, a sad goodbye for one of the only consistently enjoyable franchises we have. She did say So High School \u2026 And one final performance from another noted New Orleans performer \u2013 Jon Batiste delivers a spirited and upbeat national anthem with a little jazz flavor, accompanied by a beautifully painted piano and, naturally (because America), fighter jets. Still rolling through the music performances prior to kickoff \u2013 Trombone Shorty and contemporary Christian singer Lauren Daigle, both natives of Louisiana, perform a jazzy version of America the Beautiful. Much more successful than Fergie\u2019s infamously jazzy national anthem. An especially star-studded Super Bowl this year! Missouri native Jon Hamm introduces the Kansas City Chiefs and noted Philly fan Bradley Cooper brings in his hometown Philadelphia Eagles. And that\u2019s it from us on the teams in this game! More celebs! In fact, more celebs than usual at the Super Bowl? Here\u2019s that very patriotic Brad Pitt ad: Now we\u2019re on to a musical celebration of New Orleans, from jazz to hip-hop, marching big brass bands to bounce, featuring Harry Connick, Jr (and the voice of New Orleans cultural icon Big Freedia). A hype way to start the evening, and convincing that New Orleans is a premiere US city for live music. On a pure name recognition level, the two most famous people in attendance tonight are Taylor Swift and Donald Trump. One very much wants to be associated with the other, and one would love to have her name out of his mouth. A brief rundown of their terse relations: Trump, you may recall, published an AI-generated fake endorsement from Swift last summer. The singer \u2013 who avoided politics entirely until 2018 and remains loath to make a statement \u2013 then supported Kamala Harris with a very Taylor Instagram post calling out said fake endorsement. Trump then posted on Truth Social: \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.\u201d So I would not expect them to interact tonight, nor would I want to see it. A pre-recorded video paying tribute to the resilience and community of New Orleans in the face of the recent tragic truck attack in January. Lady Gaga, all in white, is performing an emotional performance of her Top Gun: Maverick theme to a crowd of locals and some football celebrities. It\u2019s a smart way to nod to recent events and provide a rousing kickoff to tonight\u2019s events. Video to come soon \u2026 Brad Pitt is making sure you know that football is culture. The actor just showed up in a PSA for \u2026 the Super Bowl? That was essentially a rambling collage of American propaganda. Appearing in New Orleans \u2013 an interesting choice, given the many issues with homes his foundation built there post-Katrina \u2013 Pitt waxes poetic on the football huddle as \u201ca metaphor for our history\u201d along with many platitudes on American unity, for a game Donald Trump is attending. Planes, trains and Oikos A planes, trains and automobiles theme from Dannon\u2019s Oikos Greek yoghurt: Juno Temple carries Cleveland Browns defensive end Miles Garrett on her back through a busy terminal so he can catch his plane on time. Remember when Super Bowl advertisers tried very hard to convince people to buy into crypto? (Tom Brady would love you to forget.) Or the year with weird Scientology ads? This year, the mainstream normalization push is for AI. Several companies, including Google, Meta and Salesforce, will have spots touting their AI ventures. And OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, will purportedly have their first Big Game ad, assumedly to make generative AI seem less scary to the average American consumer. We just had a pretty stirring performance from Ledisi of Lift Every Voice and Sing. Given the NFL\u2019s decision to remove the \u201cEND RACISM\u201d logos from the end zones, it\u2019s somewhat surprising the league kept on with the song \u2013 one of their big concessions to come out of Colin Kaepernick kneeling to bring awareness to social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. Kendrick vs Drake! Taylor vs Trump! That team vs that other team! Here\u2019s a look at what you can expect from tonight: Spotted: one Taylor Swift. Outfit judgment forthcoming. Ahead of the game, in the latest move of what is shaping up to be the greatest Oscar campaign in recent memory, Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet managed to get in a car with Kendrick Lamar to talk shop. And be a fan boy, of course. Full clip below: There are multiple non-football celebrities already in attendance, close-ish the normies. More to come \u2026 Kendrick gave a rare interview this week with Apple Music if you want to look for some clues of what to expect from tonight\u2019s performance: It\u2019s that time of year once again for our sports brethren to focus on the big game and for us to focus on everything else. The Super Bowl is of course primarily about football, but for us it\u2019s about the culture surrounding it. This year will see a more star-packed bundle of expensive ads than ever before with celebrities such as Charli xcx and Ben Affleck, the re-appearance of Taylor Swift and whichever big-name friends she brings along, and, most importantly, recent Grammy winner Kendrick Lamar taking over the half-time show. It\u2019s set to be an exciting night for many Americans and a hellish night for one Canadian (will Lamar perform his controversial Drake diss track to the biggest crowd of his life?) and we will be here to cover every little non-sport moment of the night, so stay tuned.",

        "headline": "Kendrick Lamar: GNX review \u2013 stunning surprise from a rapper determined to be the greatest",
        "trailText": "After his beef with Drake, Lamar expands his list of targets with enthralling rhymes and adventurous arrangements. At this point, he\u2019s deferring only to God",
        "bodyText": "By nature, hip-hop feuds are divisive, but the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was polarising in a way that had nothing to do with whose side you took. There were people who thought it was the greatest rap battle in history, outstripping Jay-Z and Nas, Ice Cube and his former bandmates in NWA, even Biggie and Tupac. Equally, there were others who questioned if it even counted as a rap battle at all: noting that both participants were already superstars, rather than a \u201cyoung, hungry MC using this as a vehicle to get to the next place\u201d, veteran critic Nelson George described it as \u201crich Black men attacking other rich Black men on their social media, from the comfort of their own homes\u201d. But whatever stance you took, it was obvious who the winner was. Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us not only landed a knockout blow, it achieved things no diss track has done before: it went to No 1, affected the campaign messaging of US election, became an American sports anthem, inspired a video game, was nominated for five Grammys \u2013 including record and song of the year \u2013 and got Lamar tapped as the headliner of the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show. It is a victory that seems to power GNX, a surprise release that couldn\u2019t be more different in tone from Lamar\u2019s last album Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, which spent 75 minutes thrashing about, filled with self-criticism and doubt, contemplating the inevitable end of his moment in the spotlight and reassuring himself that \u201cyou can\u2019t please everyone\u201d on a track called Crown. No such issues on GNX, an album that covers a lot of different topics \u2013 from romance on two duets with SZA, to the dissolution of Lamar\u2019s Black Hippy collective \u2013 but on which the overall message seems to be: who else wants some? \u201cIt used to be \u2018fuck that nigga\u2019, but now it\u2019s plural,\u201d he offers on the opening Wacced Out Murals. So it seems. Although Drake gets it in the neck again, what\u2019s striking is how his targets have now expanded to include Snoop Dogg (who posted a link to Drake\u2019s diss track Taylor Made on social media), Lil Wayne (who was apparently aggrieved about Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl slot), those with \u201cold-ass flows\u201d, people who offer \u201cbackhanded compliments\u201d, sundry unnamed figures accused of trying to \u201chate on me\u201d in Peekaboo and, potentially, Lamar\u2019s own grandma, whom he threatens to cut off \u201cif she don\u2019t see it like I see it\u201d during TV Off. You could read a lot from the fact that, SZA aside, there are no guests even remotely of Lamar\u2019s critical or commercial stature on GNX: if it seems altruistic of him to cede the mic to up-and-comers Hitta J3, Peysoh and YoungThreat on the title track, another reading might be that Lamar doesn\u2019t consider any of his actual peers to be worthy of sharing his spotlight, a feeling reinforced by Reincarnated, which appears to suggest that Lamar is the reincarnation of both John Lee Hooker and Billie Holliday (and, the sample of Made Niggaz that drives the musical backing suggests, Tupac Shakur). The track concludes with God \u2013 voiced by Lamar \u2013appearing in order to admonish him. When he does, Lamar momentarily sounds abashed. Nevertheless, a man who literally requires divine intervention to get him to wind his neck in a bit is clearly not beset by a lack of confidence. It\u2019s a huge leap from the wracked figure at the centre of Mr Morale, and it would seem faintly risible were it not for the fact that GNX is evidently an album made by an artist at the top of his game. The braggadocio is richly, hugely entertaining, his depictions of his early years and of his Los Angeles home town consistently enthralling. The rhymes shift away from Lamar\u2019s trademark storytelling, but what they lack in plotting and depth, they make up for in the sharpness of wordplay and wit: \u201cI put a square on his back like I\u2019m Jack Dorsey,\u201d he spits on Hey Now; Gloria presents itself as a love song, but turns out to be an impassioned paean to Lamar\u2019s relationship with writing. The implication behind Gloria seems to be that Lamar has got where he is \u2013 the only rapper, indeed pop artist, in history to win a Pulitzer, the name that always gets pulled out to counter old hip-hop fans\u2019 complaints about declining standards in lyrics and technique \u2013 because he works harder at his craft. Something similar is suggested by the production on GNX. Employing Jack Antonoff \u2013 who works on virtually every track here, pairing up with long-term collaborator Sounwave \u2013 is both a swaggering move and risk: the former because Antonoff is one of the hottest producers in the world, the latter because he has virtually no form in the field of hip-hop. But the results are frequently amazing: that GNX sounds more like an album aimed at the club or in-car entertainment than ponderous home listening doesn\u2019t preclude it having a rich and surprisingly eclectic sound, with room for mariachi singer Deyra Barrera and jazz hero Kamasi Washington; for the kind of abstraction found on the title track\u2019s itchy, fidgety backing and old-fashioned 80s Latin freestyle, the latter referenced on Squabble Up. It\u2019s big on beautifully deployed samples \u2013 Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn\u2019s cover of If This World Were Mine on Luther,R&amp;B trio SWV on Heart Part 6 \u2013 and on springing subtle surprises, as when, midway through TV Off, the clipped string samples are suddenly replaced by what sounds like a triumphal fanfare swiped from a movie soundtrack. If it isn\u2019t the kind of grand, complex statement found on To Pimp a Butterfly or Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, GNX is nevertheless hugely impressive: compact but substantial, punchy but broad in musical scope. \u201cI deserve it all,\u201d Lamar keeps drawling during Man at the Garden, and, at risk of swelling his head further \u2013 potentially requiring another calming visit from the man upstairs \u2013 you can understand his triumphalism.",

        "trailText": "Rapper\u2019s blue-washed pair by Celine were object of derision and lust in momentous performance",
        "bodyText": "The game on the pitch at Super Bowl on Sunday night was only half the story. As the Philadelphia Eagles led 24-0 over the Kansas City Chiefs, a pair of jeans worn by the American rapper and Pulitzer prize winner Kendrick Lamar for his half-time performance commanded their own crowd online. Variously identified as bootcut, flared and bell-bottomed, the pair of blue-wash jeans were the object of derision and lust. \u201cKendrick wearing bootcut jeans was so special,\u201d said the writer and comedian Sophia Benoit on social media. \u201cI could not take my eyes off his hems,\u201d said another user. As one TikTok user wrote: \u201cAnyone know the brand of these jeans? The fit? Amazing. The flare? Immaculate. About to order them. Best ad for jeans I\u2019ve seen in a while.\u201d They were also, in some commenters\u2019 eyes, a noteworthy and moment-enhancing choice for a performance that was hailed as history-making: Samuel L Jackson was dressed in homage to Uncle Sam; backing dancers wore red, white and blue and stood in an American flag formation, and Serena Williams crip walked. The performance, which went out to the 65,000 fans in the Superdome in New Orleans, including Donald Trump, and millions more at home, was also seen as a victory in his feud with the Canadian rapper Drake. As the cultural critic Hunter Harris wrote online: \u201cAnd he did all that in KICK FLARES!\u201d The jeans, which pooled around a pair of Nike Air Max 96s, were the work of luxury fashion label Celine and were originally designed by Hedi Slimane as part of his womenswear spring/summer 2024 collection. (Slimane stepped down from the brand in October.) Low-rise, made in Japan and costing \u00a3830, they also come with a \u201craw hem\u201d on the back, which gives the impression of a too-long jean that has been scuffed as it is trodden on \u2013 a look that teenagers in the noughties will be all too familiar with. While Dylan Kelly, an editor at Hypebeast, a magazine for men\u2019s contemporary fashion and streetwear, said he personally enjoyed a bootcut jean, he didn\u2019t think the average American was ready to see their favourite rapper in them. \u201cAnd the discourse surrounding his outfit is proof of that,\u201d he said. Whether the sight of these jeans on such a historic world stage will galvanise a moment for bootcut jeans depends on who you talk to. Arguably for some they are already there: trends in denim are divisive, labyrinthine, constantly evolving and, as with so many things, generational. Gen Z are finding a lot to love in 2000s styles and pop culture, including the cut of the era\u2019s jeans. On the other hand, those who perhaps wore them first time around, accessorised with a trucker cap, seem less likely to have been enamoured. On the men\u2019s catwalks, things have been pivoting back to more \u201cindie sleaze\u201d inspired skinny jeans. But bootcut styles are for the moment reportedly still popular with luxury shoppers: on menswear site Mr Porter, customer searches for bootcut jeans have increased by 346% in the past six months. On secondhand resale site Depop, popular with younger generations, \u201cthe popularity of the bootcut jean has been quietly bubbling under the radar over the last few months\u201d, according to a spokesperson. Searches have increased by 47% since December, with Diesel and Levi\u2019s particularly popular brands, \u201cbut this super high-profile endorsement looks to accelerate it back to centre-stage once again\u201d. Plus, they are already proving popular in womenswear, with Vogue recently sounding the bootcut klaxon. While Gap doesn\u2019t currently have any men\u2019s bootcut jeans, it is, according to its head of buying Sapna Brooks, \u201cseeing the trend and sales grow immensely across women\u2019s and girls, which indicates that they are a style a lot of people are after at the moment\u201d. If anyone was on the fence about flared, bootcut jeans before, the sight of Lamar wearing them for such a momentous event made a compelling case. Given the chatter around the return of skinny jeans, Kelly is feeling positive about what has been a divisive fashion moment: \u201cWhether or not you\u2019re a fan of his look, I think we should all be thankful that Kendrick turned the tides toward a bootcut instead.\u201d",

        "trailText": "The Pulitzer prize-winning rapper chose artistry over more obvious showmanship in an unusual set yet still delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis",
        "bodyText": "The Super Bowl half-time show is Plato\u2019s perfect form of pomp and ceremony, a corporate-sponsored, highly choreographed musical performance used to entice people who don\u2019t follow the NFL into watching TV in order to secure even higher ad fees from Doritos and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Over the years it has provided moments of great spectacle: Prince playing Purple Rain in the rain, Rihanna announcing her pregnancy flanked by hundreds of sperm-looking dancers in duvet drip \u2013 but it\u2019s never been a site of serious artistry. Its biggest controversies \u2013 Janet Jackson\u2019s nip slip, MIA\u2019s middle finger \u2013 have been teenage in their puerility. Could that change with the arrival to the Super Bowl stage of Lamar, one of this decade\u2019s great public intellectuals \u2013 a Pulitzer prize-winning rapper who has transformed the possibilities of hip-hop? It\u2019s an unlikely match for the NFL in an ordinary year, but performing in front of a president who has attacked intellectualism, Black activism and the communities in which Lamar was raised, it felt momentous before it even began. But Lamar was not necessarily looking to make a statement. He\u2019s in the most mischievous part of his career and at the crest of his mainstream popularity: in 2024 he released a series of dueling diss tracks with Drake, which culminated in Not Like Us \u2013 a song that spent the summer atop the Billboard 200 and repeatedly and specifically calls Drake a paedophile. It\u2019s a joyous song of defiance, but one with a churlish undertone that doesn\u2019t fit with the Super Bowl\u2019s inclusivity. So which Kendrick would be arriving in New Orleans? The prophet or the provocateur? In the end we got flavours of both, with an uneven but ambitious set that was arguably the most esoteric in the Super Bowl\u2019s history, perhaps at the expense of landing a knockout blow. It began with Samuel L Jackson as Uncle Sam, playing the American machine that berated Lamar: \u201cIt\u2019s your Uncle Sam, and this is the great American game!\u201d Lamar began the show atop a 1987 Buick Grand National GNX, the rare car for which his album is named. He performed an unreleased and unnamed track, known on the Kendrick Lamar subreddit as Bodies, an early sign that he wasn\u2019t in New Orleans to play crowd pleasers. His outfit also spoke to a sense of self-possession: he wore a varsity jacket by the British designer Martine Rose and the most incredible pair of boot cut jeans \u2013 something straight off the rack from mid-00s American Eagle. The set warmed up with Squabble Up and Humble as dancers flooded the stage dressed in red, white and blue tracksuits, a nod both to the Americana of the occasion and potentially a moment of unity between Compton\u2019s two rival gangs. When the all-Black dance cast started to interplay to form the American flag, it was a moment that felt weighted with significance as Trump looked on (and was rumoured to have left shortly after). As Uncle Sam Jackson yelled at Lamar that he was \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto\u201d (perhaps in a precursor to how this set will be reviewed in red states), Lamar moved into an expansive set that resembled a tarmac Compton street corner, another impressive set that was reminiscent of Es Devlin\u2019s Compton street corner that Lamar performed on with Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Eminem at the Super Bowl two years ago. It felt at times more like a Lincoln Center play than a half-time show, with dense layered flows and an interplay of dance, Jackson\u2019s spoken-word moments and Lamar album tracks that didn\u2019t always combine to make an obvious point. Lamar is able to deploy one of the greatest flows in the history of rap, but the onslaught of complex verses didn\u2019t always work in this arena and you occasionally longed for a rousing anthem like Alright or Bitch, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe. But things changed halfway through the set when he teased Not Like Us, in a funny interplay with four female dancers. As the opening bars of the song played over the PA, Kendrick joked: \u201cI want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,\u201d a reference to Drake\u2019s ongoing defamation lawsuit against the pair\u2019s shared record label, Universal Music. In the week leading up to the Super Bowl there were some rumours that the lawsuit would prevent the song being performed. And for a moment it seemed like it might be. Instead of launching into it, he played Luther and All the Stars, his pair of songs with SZA, whose soaring vocal gave the set a more layered atmosphere and useful counterbalance. Jackson even acknowledged that these more melodic numbers would appease doubting sports fans at home: \u201cThat\u2019s what America wants \u2013 nice and calm,\u201d he shouted. But then Kendrick slammed on the brakes and swerved in the opposite direction, finally unleashing Not Like Us and it felt euphoric. He revealed a maniacal grin, looking straight down the camera as he said: \u201cHey Drake\u201d, before launching into his ruinous screed. He did tone down some of the harshest blows \u2013 self-censoring the word \u201cpaedophile\u201d, likely at both his lawyers\u2019 and censors\u2019 request \u2013 but still screeched the devastating lyric: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d, flanked by huge flags that showed small children pointing to a lower-case A. As a final jibe, Serena Williams, an ex-girlfriend of Drake, was seen crip-walking by a lamp post. The Chiefs might have been losing by 27 points at half-time, but it was Drake at that moment who was the biggest loser in North America. Kendrick himself has always seen himself more as an eyewitness than an activist \u2013 or as he put it on Family Ties: \u201cI been duckin\u2019 the social gimmicks / I been duckin\u2019 the overnight activists.\u201d This was a classy, intelligent set that chose artistry over easily meme-able moments. Instead the most obvious protest was not seen on TV but in the stadium, as someone managed to join the throng and raise a Palestinian and Sudanese flag atop Kendrick\u2019s GNX. One of the most intriguing things about Lamar is you\u2019ll never know if the protester was storming the stage or a planned part of the set.",

        "bodyText": "Drake has expanded his lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us, alleging that he was defamed by Lamar\u2019s half\u2013time performance at the 2025 Super Bowl. With lyrics including \u201cSay Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young \u2026 certified lover boy? Certified paedophile,\u201d Lamar\u2019s track was one of a number of diss tracks issued by the rappers against each other in spring 2024. Not Like Us became the most commercially successful, reaching No 1 in the US and UK, and it also won Lamar five Grammy awards including record and song of the year. In January Drake sued UMG, the label that he and Lamar share, over the song, alleging UMG \u201capproved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track\u201d that was \u201cintended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\u201d. UMG argued the case was \u201cutterly without merit\u201d and called for it to be dismissed. Drake\u2019s legal team have now amended the lawsuit with new allegations, claiming that the Super Bowl performance, which was the most-watched half-time show ever, \u201cfurther solidified the public\u2019s belief in the truth of the allegations against Drake \u2026 Not only did streams of the recording increase significantly following these two mega-cultural events, but threats against Drake and his family did as well.\u201d Lamar omitted the words \u201ccertified paedophile\u201d from the performance, but included the \u201cI hear you like \u2019em young\u201d line, delivered while staring into the camera in a moment that was widely shared on social media. The omission was made, the lawsuit claims, because \u201ceveryone understands that it is defamatory to falsely brand someone a \u2018certified paedophile\u2019\u201d. Lamar is not being sued by Drake, only UMG. UMG responded to the amendments by saying: \u201cDrake, unquestionably one of the world\u2019s most accomplished artists and with whom we\u2019ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another.\u201d Drake secured a small victory in the ongoing case earlier this month, when a judge allowed his team to access certain UMG documents as they built their case, a process known as \u201cdiscovery\u201d which UMG had attempted to block. Alongside their statement about the amendments, UMG addressed that decision, saying: \u201cDrake will personally be subject to discovery as well. As the old saying goes, \u2018be careful what you wish for\u2019.\u201d Drake\u2019s team then responded in kind, saying: \u201cDrake knows exactly what he asked for: the truth and accountability.\u201d Elsewhere at the Super Bowl show, Serena Williams \u2013 who reportedly once dated Drake \u2013 danced on stage to Not Like Us, an appearance which was perceived by some viewers as mocking Drake. Asked by Time magazine this week whether that was the case, Williams said: \u201cAbsolutely not. I would never do that. And that was sad, that anyone would ever think that. I respect how they could \u2026 But absolutely not. I have never had negative feelings towards him. We\u2019ve known him for so many years.\u201d Drake and Lamar are also currently locked in another battle, for the top of the US singles chart. Lamar\u2019s track Luther, featuring SZA, has been at No 1 for eight weeks, but Drake\u2019s track Nokia has returned to the No 2 spot this week.",

        "trailText": "Another individual, aged 23, was arrested for criminal trespassing during NFL game in New Orleans",
        "bodyText": "A performer in Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl half-time show was ejected after unfurling a combination Sudanese-Palestinian flag with \u201cSudan\u201d and \u201cGaza\u201d written on it \u2013 but he is not going to face legal charges, police said. The National Football League confirmed the person was part of the 400-member field cast who performed alongside Lamar at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans but said the man had no permission to display the flag. A statement from the New Orleans police department said the performer in question was \u201cdetained\u201d and \u201cejected from the stadium after the incident\u201d, but \u201cno arrest [was made] nor summons was issued\u201d. Police said they would not name the ejected person. Nonetheless, in a conversation with the Daily Mail, Z\u00fcl-Qarnain Nantambu \u2013 who discusses politics as well as his life as a Muslim in the US on his Open Book Platform channel on YouTube \u2013 identified himself as the ejected performer. Nantambu reportedly told the Daily Mail that he had been hired as a participant in Lamar\u2019s show about two weeks before the Super Bowl. He said the Grammy winner had no idea about the demonstration Nantambu was planning \u2013 something meant to \u201cshow solidarity with the people\u201d victimized by ongoing conflicts in those parts of the world. \u201cWe have a life of luxury in comparison to what they\u2019re going through,\u201d said Nantambu, who lists himself as a musician, film-maker, fashion designer and freedom fighter, according to the Daily Mail. A separate statement from an NFL spokesperson, Brian McCarthy, said the ejected performer would be \u201cbanned for life from all [league] stadiums and events\u201d. The cast member stood on a car used as a prop for Lamar\u2019s performance and held up the flag. He then leapt off the vehicle and the stage when approached by a production crew member, as video circulated on social media shows. He subsequently ran around the field while holding up the flag before men in suits who were providing security detained him. Louisiana state police troopers could then be seen escorting the performer out. McCarthy\u2019s statement said the \u201cindividual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show\u201d. \u201cNo one involved with the production was aware of the individual\u2019s intent,\u201d McCarthy said. Roc Nation, the entertainment company which produced the show, said that the act \u201cwas neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal\u201d. Lamar completed his performance without interruption. On social media associated with Nantambu, the flag he was holding could be seen briefly on the television broadcast of Lamar\u2019s show while the tennis superstar Serena Williams did what is known as a crip walk \u2013 a dance move out of her and the lyricist\u2019s home town of Los Angeles. State troopers at the Superdome on Sunday encountered at least one other person who was accused of doing something that they were not supposed to do. Alec Nguyen, described as a 23-year-old resident of South Amboy, New Jersey, was spotted wearing a fake identification card by security personnel in the Superdome at about 9.25pm on Sunday, state police wrote in court documents that were obtained by the Guardian. Troopers approached Nguyen after he allegedly refused to answer security workers\u2019 questions about the false credential. He allegedly declined to answer troopers\u2019 questions, too, prompting them to arrest Nguyen on counts of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest by refusing to identify himself. According to court documents, troopers who searched Nguyen found \u201cnumerous items of audio and visual recording equipment on him\u201d. New Orleans magistrate court judge Jonathan Friedman set Nguyen\u2019s bail Monday at $3,000. The Associated Press contributed reporting",

        "trailText": "Drake was humiliated on record, at the Grammys and now in a football stadium. But as a crisis expert attests, there\u2019s a way he could still return to relevance",
        "bodyText": "It\u2019s fitting that the Drake-Kendrick Lamar beef should end up on the Super Bowl field: \u201cMy intent from day one was to keep the nature of it as a sport,\u201d Lamar said in an interview prior to his half-time show on Sunday. As the two rappers\u2019 enmity built into a series of back-and-forth diss tracks in spring 2024, writers reached for boxing metaphors, describing \u201csparring\u201d, \u201ctrading blows\u201d or delivering \u201chaymakers\u201d. It was reminiscent of Pusha T\u2019s words to the Guardian after his own spat with Drake: \u201cWhat has been more energetic than this?\u201d And of Drake\u2019s own words on one of his earliest hits: \u201cSports and music are so synonymous / Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us.\u201d Drake fans might grumble that Lamar is now being less than sporting: having clearly won the beef thanks to the huge US No 1 success of Not Like Us \u2013 which framed Drake as a paedophile, a claim Drake outright rejected \u2013 he is now gleeful in victory. Last month he went to collect five Grammy awards for Not Like Us dressed in a \u201cCanadian tuxedo\u201d: Drake is from Toronto. At the Super Bowl, he brought out Serena Williams to dance during Not Like Us: Drake and Williams were once rumoured to be dating, and Drake later wrote hurt lyrics about her. Lamar\u2019s special guest SZA was one of Drake\u2019s own beloved creative foils. Lamar himself grinned down the camera as he rapped: \u201cSay Drake, I hear you like \u2018em young\u201d. At both events, thousands-strong crowds chanted \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d, a line about paedophilia, at full volume \u2013 it was, Billboard stated, \u201ceven more deafening in the Superdome than the telecast suggested\u201d. Kendrick wore a lower-case \u201ca\u201d pendant which some fans read as a reference to the line. The \u201cstop, he\u2019s already dead\u201d Simpsons quote is being much shared, and has never been so appropriate. \u201cKendrick Lamar didn\u2019t just perform at the Super Bowl \u2013 he set a cultural agenda,\u201d says Lauren Beeching, a UK-based expert in crisis PR for celebrities. \u201cHe\u2019s put so many intelligent Easter eggs throughout the performance; the level of thought and detail in his performance means that this is going to be talked about for days, not hours.\u201d Worse still for Drake, it was at the most popular sporting event in the US calendar. \u201cRegular people are going to learn about it,\u201d Beeching says. \u201cThey\u2019ll be Googling: why is this news? If you open TikTok it\u2019s everywhere. So this is being introduced to so many new people.\u201d The beef has clearly energised Lamar: his self-reflexive 2022 album Mr Morale &amp; the Big Steppers was a touch underrated, but there\u2019s no doubt the more playful, oxygenated flow he\u2019s now using is thrilling. Audiences meanwhile love this gossipy, reference-rich sport. But what of Drake? He was once the world\u2019s most-streamed artist, who seemingly had an easy command of every style he turned his hand to: trap, R&amp;B, pop, dancehall, house and more. Now, he\u2019s humiliated and flailing for credibility. A failing was perhaps in trying to appeal to all of those audiences at once. There may well have been genuine passion in forming his collaborations with UK artists such as Section Boyz and Headie One, but \u2013 worsened with how he would sometimes mould his accent to south London, Jamaica and more \u2013 he became seen as a tourist who was extracting more cultural capital than he was giving back. It meant that when Lamar wrote another devastating section of Not Like Us, where he frames Drake as a leech absorbing cred from Atlanta artists like Future and Lil Baby, many listeners nodded along. More prosaically, Drake has had backlash from suing his own label, UMG, over the allegations made in Not Like Us. \u201cAs a rapper it\u2019s not the right look \u2013 it\u2019s kind of disrespecting your own trade, and looks hypocritical,\u201d Beeching says. She says that \u201csilence is key for someone like that right now,\u201d and that when one of her clients gets drawn into a spat, \u201cthe first day is generally me begging them to not do anything publicly. His smartest move is to just wait, and come back with something that reframes the conversation entirely; a defensive response would be a mistake for him. If Drake tries to reclaim credibility in rap it could feel forced, what with him trying to sue. But maybe he could lean into another aspect of his brand\u201d \u2013 one of those other styles, such as pop or R&amp;B. \u201cLuckily he\u2019s commercially successful enough to be able to do that quite easily.\u201d Yet Drake seems unwilling to do that. After the diss tracks ended, he wrote on an image of a samurai facing an army: \u201cGood times. Summer vibes up next.\u201d Had he followed through on that promise, and gifted summer 2024 a more carefree pop-leaning track in the style of One Dance, Hotline Bling or Rich Baby Daddy, he would have reminded the world that here was a style which Lamar, for all his Pulitzer-winning acclaim, has never mastered. And then, perhaps, Drake could have worked his way back to rap credibility. Beeching gives an example of someone who handled a difficult moment well: Taylor Swift, after she was drawn into a feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, and initially painted as a villain. \u201cInstead of fighting back immediately, she disappeared: no statements, no interviews, no social media. Then she returned with Reputation, which acknowledged the backlash but on her terms, without engaging in messy public feuds. She didn\u2019t take the bait, basically.\u201d But instead of pivoting to pop, Drake released three pure rap tracks \u2013 one of them with two Atlanta stars, Young Thug and 21 Savage, as if to reclaim his relevance in the city. Later, in January, came a freestyle in which he complained about the friends lost to the Lamar beef. After the Grammys, he went on stage in Australia wearing a vest with smoke pouring out of simulated bullet holes, to say: I\u2019m still standing. Whether this is dignified or corny depends on how much of a Drake stan you are, but it\u2019s undeniable how much the beef continues to affect him \u2013 and how his ego, which helped to make him such a big star, won\u2019t let him move on. Will the world let him, either? \u201cKendrick didn\u2019t just challenge Drake musically, he\u2019s damaged his character in a way that will linger,\u201d Beeching concludes, and yet at the same time, the public tend to \u201cforget really fast and easily \u2013 there\u2019s so many public figures right now who were once cancelled or humiliated, who have come back after being quiet for a bit\u201d. Unlike so many of those figures, Drake has never been charged with a crime; he\u2019s been gossiped about and has had some dubious moments, but has never seriously crossed a line in public, in the manner of Will Smith. His streaming numbers have dropped somewhat, but on Spotify there are still 74m people listening to him each month. And while Lamar will carry on performing Not Like Us on his stadium tour with SZA this spring \u2013 and everyone will sing along again with the \u201cA minor\u201d line \u2013 his victory lap for the beef will now come to a close, and he will probably move on from it. Drake is now 38. That\u2019s old in pop terms \u2013 like so many before him, he will almost certainly not remain relevant to each successive generation \u2013 but it\u2019s young for an artist, and he remains versatile. He would be unwise to revisit it yet, but the encounter with Lamar, and the way Drake comes to live with it, could still interestingly shape his artistry.

This documentary explores the wider context of the rappers\u2019 cultural status, and what exactly led to a public spat that resulted in a diss track with (strongly denied) accusations of paedophilia. Hollie Richardson Mary\u2019s Foolproof Dinners 7.30pm, BBC Two She\u2019s back \u2013 and just in time for some homely dishes for those long, dark autumn nights. In this new series, Mary Berry helps celebrity friends to cook comfort foods. First up, she shows Alan Carr how to rustle up Parma ham and cauliflower parcels, and honey-mustard chicken with potatoes. HR The Great British Bake Off 8pm, Channel 4 It\u2019s autumn week, and judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith assess the seven remaining contestants on a signature seasonal pie, a parkin cake technical and a vegetable-based showstopper inspired by an autumnal festival \u2013 including a Diwali cake with beetroot sponge and a Day of the Dead carrot and courgette creation.

The others take in the sights while he relives his performance in the 1999 Champions League semi-final. Phil Harrison Storyville: Eternal You 10pm, BBC Four It could be confused for an episode of Black Mirror but this is an eerie and very real look at how AI is being used by bereaved people who want to interact with their deceased loved ones.

        "trailText": "In this week\u2019s newsletter: Just when it seemed there was nothing shocking about an unexpected album drop, Lamar made a truly transgressive move ",
        "bodyText": "Friday afternoons are better known as a time to quietly bury bad news, not loudly drop one of the biggest albums of the year \u2013 but Kendrick Lamar doesn\u2019t really operate by the usual rules of media engagement. The rapper\u2019s recent career path has felt wildly counterintuitive: right as he seemed to be settling into a position of critical adoration but commercial mid-tierness, releasing head-scratchingly ruminative 18-track double albums like Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, he roared back with the biggest hit of his career. The fact that said hit was a diss track \u2013 the sort of slightly grubby, inside baseball affair usually tucked away on mix tapes or the back halves of albums \u2013 made it stranger still, not to mention that it made some pretty wild allegations about one of the biggest musicians on the planet. So it was fittingly contrary that Lamar\u2019s victory lap, in the form of sixth studio album GNX, arrived not on the back of a months-long media onslaught but with a sudden drop last Friday that left music editors scrambling to cover it before clocking off (though Kendrick\u2019s late Friday release did allow critics the weekend to get their heads around it before filing their reviews on Monday). GNX was a surprise album in the truest form, too \u2013 there was none of the breadcrumbs you often get in these situations: just a one-minute YouTube teaser and 30 minutes later, bam! Perhaps the biggest surprise was that Lamar opted for a surprise release at all. Because it had seemed that the surprise album release era was very much over, 12 years after it began. That 12-year number is up for debate: lots of people would argue that the first surprise album was Radiohead\u2019s In Rainbows in 2007 (though that release was technically announced just over a week before it came out). But the real liftoff moment for the surprise album was in 2013, and the release, ushered out in the bleary early hours of a mid-December morning, of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled album. It was a move that felt thrillingly new: that the biggest artist in the world, a position that comes with carefully managed publicity campaigns, would sidestep all that and just put the thing out there, seemed almost transgressive. (Although in retrospect it maybe was just a savvy understanding of the direction of travel: the weakening power of traditional media campaigns and the rise of fan-powered spontaneity.) Naturally, the phenomenon exploded after that: U2 did their foolhardy, if in retrospect pretty brave, iTunes stunt around their album Songs of Innocence the following September, and we were off to the races. By 2016, as Eamonn Forde notes in this Guardian piece, it was almost expected for an album to be launched out into the world with minimal promotion, that the most surprising thing you could do with your new album was trail it with a handful of appearances, a couple of broadsheet interviews and an appearance on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s show. Frank Ocean, Taylor Swift, Eminem, Bj\u00f6rk: everywhere you looked, any musician with any clout (as well plenty without) started dabbling in sudden album drops. At the same time, the term \u201csurprise album\u201d seemed to lose its meaning altogether, with it being used to refer to anything short of floating a statue of the artist in question down the Thames. The overuse of the surprise album, both the term and the thing itself, would ultimately doom it. The 2020s have seen a steady decline in the number of big-name surprise releases. Possibly the format\u2019s last true triumph, before GNX, was the release of Taylor Swift\u2019s Folklore, and its follow-up Evermore, as Covid raged in 2020. That made sense at the time \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to mount a whopping great promo campaign in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 but Swift soon reverted to a more traditional promo campaign for her next album, Midnights, in 2022. So it seemed did everyone else: the biggest albums of 2024 \u2013 the likes of Swift\u2019s Tortured Poets Department, Billie Eilish\u2019s Hit Me Hard and Soft and, yep, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Carter \u2013 have stuck to more old-school release schedules, often complete with lavish campaigns (as music site Loud &amp; Quiet\u2019s Midnight Chats podcast recently laid out). Enter Lamar and GNX. Will its success jumpstart another wave of surprise releases? God, I hope not. The surprise album works forLamar \u2013 someone with an aura of mystery, artistic integrity and sheer bloody-mindedness around them \u2013 and maybe a handful of others at the top of the pile. And it also works for bands and artists considered broken up or at least long dormant: My Bloody Valentine\u2019s 2013 album m b v was a fantastic surprise album because, even though it had effectively been trailed for the best part of two decades, no one ever expected it to come out, let alone suddenly on a random night in February. For everyone else, the best advice is to leave the surprise album well alone. Stick to the good old-fashioned promo campaign. Have fun with it \u2013 hire an arena for a listening party or burn a million quid or something. Just give us a heads-up first.

        "trailText": "Drake\u2019s attorneys accuse Universal of being \u2018a greedy company\u2019 that is \u2018finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation\u2019.",
        "bodyText": "Universal Music Group have moved to dismiss Drake\u2019s defamation suit, characterising it as \u201ca misguided attempt\u201d by the Canadian rapper to \u201csalve his wounds\u201d after he \u201clost a rap battle\u201d with rival Kendrick Lamar. In the motion, filed on Monday in the US district court for the southern district of New York, Universal Music Group (UMG), which represents both artists, claimed that Drake \u201clost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated. \u201cInstead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice\u201d. The long-term rivalry between Drake and Kendrick Lamar escalated in March 2024 with the rapid-fire, tit-for-tat release of diss tracks by both artists, culminating in the release of Not Like Us on 4 May, in which Lamar framed Drake as a \u201ccertified pedophile\u201d. The track proved immensely popular, topping the Billboard Global 200 chart and winning Record and Song of the Year at the 2025 Grammys. Drake filed a lawsuit in January accusing UMG of defamation and harassment, and alleging that UMG \u201capproved, published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track\u201d that was \u201cintended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\u201d. Drake\u2019s suit noted that the artwork for Not Like Us features a picture of his Toronto home with markers used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders; and referred to a shooting that occurred outside the residence days after the track\u2019s release in which a security guard was injured, and two attempted trespassings in the subsequent days. \u201cThis lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\u201d the filing by Drake\u2019s team read. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d In its motion to dismiss, Universal argue that Drake fails to make a claim for defamation, saying that Not Like Us \u201cconveys nonactionable opinion and rhetorical hyperbole, not fact,\u201d and noting that the rapper has relied on UMG to promote his own diss tracks against Lamar and others. Drake\u2019s lawsuit, UMG says in its filing, \u201cdisregards the other Drake and Lamar diss tracks that surrounded \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 as well as the conventions of the diss track genre \u2026 diss tracks are a popular and celebrated artform centered around outrageous insults, and they would be severely chilled if Drake\u2019s suit were permitted to proceed.\u201d \u201cLess than three years ago, Drake himself signed a public petition criticizing \u2018the trend of prosecutors using artists\u2019 creative expression against them\u2019 by treating rap lyrics as literal fact,\u201d UMG\u2019s motion continues. \u201cAs Drake recognized, when it comes to rap, \u2018[t]he final work is a product of the artist\u2019s vision and imagination\u2019. \u201cDrake was right then and is wrong now.\u201d Universal also denies that its promotion of Not Like Us invited harassment of Drake, stating that the rapper is attempting \u201cto contort violent metaphors in the lyrics into incitement\u201d. \u201cAs with his defamation claim, Drake seeks to chill a form of artistic expression that he himself has embraced,\u201d the motion reads. In a statement provided to Variety, Drake\u2019s attorney Michael J. Gottlieb responded to Universal\u2019s motion to dismiss, saying: \u201cUMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence. \u201cThis motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG\u2019s long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists.\u201d",

        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",

        "headline": "Drake claims UMG and Spotify \u2018artificially inflated\u2019 Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us",
        "trailText": "Feud escalates as rapper\u2019s lawyers file two petitions alleging Universal Music Group and streaming giant conspired while also accusing them of defamation",
        "bodyText": "Drake has launched two legal actions against Universal Music Group (UMG) and Spotify, alleging they conspired to artificially inflate interest in Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track about him, Not Like Us, while suppressing his own music, as well as accusing them of defamation. In a petition filed to the New York supreme court on Monday, attorneys for Drake\u2019s company Frozen Moments LLC accused UMG and the streaming service of having \u201claunched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves\u201d, using various tactics to make Lamar\u2019s song more popular. \u201cUMG \u2026 conspired with and paid currently unknown parties to use \u2018bots\u2019 to artificially inflate the spread of Not Like Us and deceive consumers into believing the song was more popular than it was in reality,\u201d Drake\u2019s lawyers write. The petition also alleges that UMG paid influencers to promote Not Like Us on social media and set up pay-to-play agreements with radio stations. A day later, Drake filed a separate legal action in Texas accusing UMG of defamation. The filing, which like the legal action in New York is not a lawsuit but a request for information from key players for a potential future lawsuit, claims that the company was aware that Not Like Us \u201cfalsely\u201d accused him of pedophilia, but distributed the track anyway. According to the petition, the company \u201ccould have refused to release or distribute the song or required the offending material to be edited and/or removed. But UMG chose to do the opposite. UMG designed, financed and then executed a plan to turn Not Like Us into a viral mega-hit with the intent of using the spectacle of harm to Drake and his businesses to drive consumer hysteria and, of course, massive revenues. That plan succeeded, likely beyond UMG\u2019s wildest expectations.\u201d In the petition, Drake\u2019s attorneys said they had enough evidence to demonstrate defamation by UMG, and that they were considering allegations of civil fraud and racketeering. A spokesperson for UMG told the Guardian: \u201cThe suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\u201d Spotify declined to comment. Both Drake and Lamar have been associated with UMG for their entire careers: Drake via Republic Records and Lamar via Interscope. The company owns both labels. But it is an extraordinary step in an escalating battle between the two rappers, which began as an exchange of diss tracks. In songs including Euphoria, Meet the Grahams and Not Like Us, Lamar accused Drake of having sexual relationships with underage girls, as well as fathering secret children. In response, Drake released tracks including Family Matters and The Heart Part 6, which accused Lamar of domestic abuse and infidelity, criticised his collaboration with Taylor Swift and mocked his height. Both Drake and Lamar have always denied any wrongdoing. Drake\u2019s petition alleges that UMG reduced the licensing rates it charges Spotify in exchange for the streamer recommending Lamar\u2019s track to its users even when they searched for unrelated songs or artists. The petition also claims that UMG paid Apple to make its digital assistant Siri \u201cpurposely misdirect\u201d users who asked to listen to Drake\u2019s songs to instead stream Not Like Us. The petition also alleges that UMG\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d led to Not Like Us being streamed 900m times, making it the most-streamed diss track in Spotify history. The track holds Spotify records for biggest single-day streams for a hip-hop song (12.8m) and the most song streams in a week by a rapper (81.2m). Drake\u2019s attorneys allege that \u201cUMG\u2019s schemes \u2026 were motivated, at least in part, by the desire of executives at Interscope to maximize their own profits\u201d, and that the success of Not Like Us had led to a boost in streaming of Lamar\u2019s back catalogue, which financially benefited UMG. The petition claims Drake \u201crepeatedly sought to engage UMG in discussions to resolve the ongoing harm he has suffered as a result of UMG\u2019s actions\u201d but claims that the music giant has \u201cno interest in taking responsibility for its misconduct\u201d and instead \u201cpointed the finger\u201d at Lamar, directing Drake to sue the rapper and not UMG. Drake\u2019s attorneys claim they had \u201creceived information that UMG has been taking steps in an apparent effort to conceal its schemes, including, but not limited to, by terminating employees associated with or perceived as having loyalty to Drake\u201d. They allege UMG violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \u2013 a federal statute widely known as \u201cRico\u201d, which is often used in criminal cases against organised crime \u2013 as well as deceptive business practices and false advertising.",

        "bodyText": "For the second time in three seasons, Philadelphia and Kansas City will face each other for the championship. Here\u2019s what to know about kickoff time, the host city, the half-time show with Kendrick Lamar and more. What time is the Super Bowl? Super Bowl LIX will air on Sunday 9 February, with kickoff at 6.30pm ET (11.30pm GMT, 10.30am Monday AEDT). Who is performing the half-time show? Kendrick Lamar will headline the half-time show, with special guest SZA. He appeared during the 2022 half-time show, alongside a supergroup of hip-hop and R&amp;B legends. Here are the half-time performers for the last decade: 2025: Kendrick Lamar (with SZA) 2024: Usher 2023: Rihanna 2022: Eminem, Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J Blige 2021: The Weeknd 2020: Shakira and Jennifer Lopez (with Bad Bunny, J Balvin and Emme Mu\u00f1iz) 2019: Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Big Boi 2018: Justin Timberlake (with the Tennessee Kids) 2017: Lady Gaga 2016: Coldplay (with Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars) 2015: Katy Perry (with Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott) What time will Kendrick Lamar perform the half-time show? The Grammy-winning rapper will headline the half-time show, which will kick off sometime between 8 and 8.30pm. He is likely to bring the controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us to US\u2019s biggest TV audience of the year Where is the Super Bowl held this year? The Super Bowl will be played at the indoor Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The stadium, which opened in 1975, is the fifth-oldest stadium in the NFL, and has a capacity of about 75,000. Super Bowl LIX will be the 11th time New Orleans has played host, tying with Miami for the most hosted championship games. How to watch the Super Bowl Fox will carry the Super Bowl live in the US. The game will also be available to stream on the Fox Sports website and app, along with the NFL+ app. The Guardian has live blog coverage of the Super Bowl. In the UK, the Super Bowl is free to air on ITV1 and ITVX. It is also available on Sky Sports and the NFL Game Pass on DAZN, among other channels. Sports fans can listen to the audio stream on BBC Radio 5 Live. In Australia, the game is available on Channel 7, 7mate and 7plus starting at 9.30am AEDT on 10 February. The game will also be available to stream on Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now. How to stream the Super Bowl without cable Streamers Hulu, FuboTV, Sling TV and YouTube TV will also carry the game live. SiriusXM and Fox+ will also carry an audio broadcast of the game. What about the commercials? It\u2019s expected that more than 120 million US viewers will tune in to Sunday\u2019s match, with ad spots reportedly selling for $8m-plus for 30 seconds. Fox wouldn\u2019t confirm final pricing for ad spots, which sold out in November; however, last year, a 30-second spot went for around a reported $7m. The Guardian will cover the half-time show in our Everything but the Football live blog. Several ad spots, including a Squarespace ad featuring Barry Keoghan (and a donkey), Glen Powell for Ram Trucks, and Catherine O\u2019Hara and Willem Dafoe for Michelob Ultra, are already available to stream. Andy Reid, head coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, stars in an ad for Skechers as well. Who performed the national anthem? Grammy award-winning musician Jon Batiste performed the national anthem before the game. In 2024, country singer Reba McEntire sang the Star-Spangled Banner.",

        "trailText": "It\u2019s tough to call the quality-stacked top categories, featuring Academy darlings such as Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift alongside pop\u2019s new tyros",
        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink). Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best country solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 16 Carriages Jelly Roll \u2013 I Am Not Okay Kacey Musgraves \u2013 The Architect Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Chris Stapleton \u2013 It Takes a Woman In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "trailText": "Kendrick Lamar celebrated his rap beef victory in a \u2018Canadian tuxedo\u2019, Chappell Roan called out the industry and Nashville finally backed Beyonc\u00e9",
        "bodyText": "Drake was humiliated It\u2019s the kind of stress dream that pop stars tell their therapists about: \u201cMy artistic rival won record and song of the year at the Grammys for a track attacking me, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Even Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d And so it came to pass for Drake, seeing Kendrick Lamar win for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim \u2013 a \u201cCanadian tuxedo\u201d, no less \u2013 while half the arena seemed to chant \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably a minor\u201d, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn\u2019t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards \u2013 and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar \u2013 the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake? Chappell Roan called for workers\u2019 rights \u2026 For all her playfulness on stage and on record, there\u2019s also a seriousness of intent to Chappell Roan: part of the reason she\u2019s so loved is that she totally devotes herself to her craft, selling every line she sings. That\u2019s played out in her earnest politics, too, whether upbraiding a hectoring paparazzo, fretting about who to back (if anyone) in the US presidential race, and championing the rights of queer people and Palestinians. At the Grammys, she used the platform of a best new artist win to advocate for workers\u2019 rights, namely her fellow musicians, with a \u201cdemand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\u201d She spoke of struggling to afford health insurance in her early career, saying: \u201cIt was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised to not have health[care]. If my label would have prioritised artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to \u2026 Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d \u2026 and Lady Gaga for trans rights As Donald Trump enshrines transphobia in American law, Lady Gaga spoke out, saying: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d She was speaking after winning best pop duo/group performance for Die With a Smile, with Bruno Mars. Doechii capped her breakthrough year \u2026 Twenty-six-year-old rapper Doechii beat some of the most venerable, successful and respected MCs in the US \u2013 Eminem, Future, J Cole and the paired-up Common and Pete Rock \u2013 to win best rap album, only the third woman to win this category after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. This caps a stunning breakthrough over the past year, with jaws floored by the emphatically enunciated, elastically rhythmic raps on her album Alligator Bites Don\u2019t Heal, and then again by performances such as on Stephen Colbert\u2019s talkshow, her braided hair fused to that of her dancers. Her performance on the Grammys\u2019 stage was even stronger, a brilliantly choreographed strut through Denial Is a River where \u2013 with some expert help from her DJ, Miss Milan \u2013 she kept her flow going through high kicks, trust falls and a suit-busting bikini reveal. \u2026 as did Sierra Ferrell With her fourth album, Ferrell made a clean sweep of the roots and Americana categories, winning all four of the awards she was nominated for (in a less brutally competitive year, she would have got a best new artist nomination too). Dressed in one of the night\u2019s wackier outfits \u2013 think East End pearly queen after five rounds of AI enhancement, complete with sceptre \u2013 she\u2019s travelled a long way from the trailer-dwelling and freight train-hopping of her youth, to become a multimillion-streaming performer. As country and pop do-si-do ever more tightly, Ferrell, Zach Bryan and more are winning millions of fans drawn to a more authentic and analogue-sounding version of this vintage American music. Beyonc\u00e9 finally won album of the year She may have been the most-awarded star in history, but given the industry places such stock in the album format, Beyonc\u00e9 not winning that category felt like a big snub \u2013 particularly given her self-titled album lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase (not remotely the best album that year or in his own catalogue), while her great masterpiece 4 wasn\u2019t even nominated. So that wrong has now been righted. Some may be dismayed that it took a country album to do it, rather than an R&amp;B, pop or dance record \u2013 and Cowboy Carter has plenty of longueurs and even outright missteps. But it also contains some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most imaginative and beautiful music \u2013 the way Riverdance flows into II Hands II Heaven makes it the loveliest brace of songs on an album in her catalogue. Its bigger win in some ways is best country album, showing that Beyonc\u00e9 has convinced not just the broad pool of voters in the general field categories, but also the Nashville establishment who vote for the country awards. An American won best global music album Matt B, a little-streamed musician born and raised in Illinois and based in the US, beat representatives from Spain (Antonio Rey), Peru (Ciro Hurtado), and Nigeria (superstars Tems and Rema) to win best global music album for Alkebulan II, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. His album certainly creates a global dialogue, as he explores his African heritage with multilingual lyrics, lilting Afro-pop, and guests such as South African poet Nomfundo Khambule. But as the US enters its protectionist era under Trump, there may be some disquiet at this win. A multimillionare businesswoman won best new age album It\u2019s a shame that the great Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician who died of cancer aged 71 in 2023 having changed the face of his country\u2019s popular music, wasn\u2019t honoured in the category for best new age, ambient or chant album. His nominated LP Opus was full of his very particular piano style, full of chords that feel cautious and yet intentional, and where sentimentality is offset by chalky, dissonant notes. Instead, he lost to the little-heard Triveni by Wouter Kellerman, Eru Matsumoto and Chandrika Tandon, the latter a businesswoman and philanthropist (and sister of former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi) who worked for McKinsey before starting her own financial services firm. The Academy still loves Chris Stapleton He lost to Beyonc\u00e9 in the country album category, but Stapleton notched up his fifth win in 10 years in the best country solo performance category, a mark of how much the country-voting portion of the Recording Academy adores this artist, who pleases both staunch traditionalists while being relatively progressive \u2013 that\u2019s 11 wins overall for him now. It\u2019s a shame, though, that he won with a low-stakes ballad from the same album as his win last year, while shutting out Shaboozey\u2019s pop culturally dominant A Bar Song (Tipsy) in the process. Chris Brown was awarded Way after his notorious assault on Rihanna, Chris Brown has been accused of a long list of crimes against numerous women over the years, which he has denied \u2013 last week he sued over how he was represented in a new documentary, with lawyers saying: \u201cMr Brown has never been found guilty of any sex related crime \u2026 but this documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.\u201d His win for best R&amp;B album, over a big breakthrough by Muni Long and another veteran in Usher, plus others, shows that he still has his backers in the Recording Academy. But there has been disquiet online \u2013 just as there has for Kanye West\u2019s red carpet appearance with his wife, Bianca Censori essentially appearing nude, the latest in a series of mute, near-undressed appearances alongside him that have provoked widespread concern for her welfare. Female artists did well \u2013 but men still dominate behind the scenes Two of the \u201cbig four\u201d were won by female artists, but when you look into the actual winners, they were overwhelmingly male. These awards are shared by the producers, songwriters, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers and while there is some heartening female representation \u2013 such as Idania Valencia who mastered Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, and songwriters such as Elizabeth Lowell Boland and songwriter of the year winner Amy Allen \u2013 analysis by Akas found that only 9% of winners in the top four categories were women. And it was a bad night for the Brits Charli xcx was the chief British representative, and she gave an instantly viral bum-wiggling, underwear-chucking live performance of Guess on the night, but she was shut out of the big prizes, making do with dance-pop awards. And it wasn\u2019t a great night for other Brits. Belfast\u2019s Jordan Adetunji was beaten to the melodic rap prize by Rapsody and Erykah Badu, Raye lost out twice, while Jacob Collier\u2019s seventh win was a minor award, for arrangement. Instead we had to rely on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones for some face-saving wins, for best rock performance and album respectively (while Sean Ono Lennon also picked up an award, for co-creating the box set release of his father\u2019s album Mind Games). \u2022 This article was updated on 3 February with a correction: Beyonce\u2019s self-titled album, not Lemonade, lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase.",

        "bodyText": "Like all major awards ceremonies, the Grammys spawn a mini-industry in predictions: in the weeks before the winners are announced, a rash of articles inevitably appear in which expert voices scan the nominations and foretell who\u2019s going to win. This year, you didn\u2019t really need in-depth knowledge of the music industry or the Recording Academy\u2019s internal machinations to work out what was going to happen, unless there was a major upset. Across the previous 12 months, a succession of artists impacted in a way that pop music is no longer supposed to do. Its once-central defining role within broader popular culture is held to have been vastly diminished by social media, and yet Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us wasn\u2019t just a huge commercial success, it influenced everything, from US sports to the campaign messaging of the American presidential election to sales of the fashion brands featured in its video: if you were going to dub anything the song of the year, it was obviously going to be that. Likewise, Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, an album which caught a mood so completely, its title wound up a widely used (if nebulously defined) adjective: the notion of it ending the night unrewarded seemed fairly unthinkable (though it didn\u2019t triumph in its biggest nominated categories). Moreover, Brat was part of a noticeable shift in the tone of mainstream pop music, away from impeccably styled, media-trained, Instagram-filtered perfection towards something messier, more heartfelt and personal, a state of affairs it would have been faintly nuts for the Academy not to recognise. This wasn\u2019t merely the kind of trend that provokes think pieces from critics and ups the general quality of pop music \u2013 it was one that also sold millions of records by Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, both of whom deservedly did well on the night. Should anyone doubt that a new mood in pop is abroad, it\u2019s worth noting that Roan turned up to the ceremony wearing a wimple and drag-queen makeup and spent her acceptance speech excoriating the music industry for its unwillingness to provide young artists with a living wage in an era of record profits. You probably wouldn\u2019t have expected that from the best new artist winner a few years back, but it\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that Chappell Roan does: she\u2019s both impressively outspoken and possessed of a very original take on how a pop star should look. Elsewhere, you could certainly argue the Beyonc\u00e9 albums that failed to snare the album of the year category in previous years were qualitatively better than the album that finally won it \u2013 certainly, 2016\u2019s Lemonade and 2022\u2019s Renaissance were more consistent and conceptually more coherent \u2013 but you\u2019d be harder pushed to make a case that Cowboy Carter wasn\u2019t impactful enough. For all it seemed to tire of its Beyonc\u00e9-goes-country theme midway through, throwing in everything from hip-hop to psychedelic soul, Cowboy Carter felt of the moment. It featured Shaboozey \u2013 ahead of his single A Bar Song (Tipsy) spending a record-setting 19 weeks at the top of the US chart \u2013 and it was part of the ongoing vogue for pop artists shifting their sound towards something more country-adjacent, unencumbered by the kind of this-isn\u2019t-country dismissal from Nashville that famously dogged Lil Nas X\u2019s similarly successful Old Town Road five years ago. Indeed, the closest the Grammys came to controversy \u2013 aside from awards for Chris Brown and Dave Chappelle, and a provocative appearance by Kanye West and his wife \u2013 was when it seemed most traditional, handing out the best rock performance gong to the Beatles for Now and Then. You could view that as merely an act of sentiment \u2013 Now and Then was, after all, dubbed \u201cthe last Beatles single\u201d, a final leave-taking from the biggest band of all time \u2013 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that it was a rock performance that required AI to make it happen, previous attempts at extracting a usable vocal from John Lennon\u2019s unfinished 1977 demo having failed because the equipment wasn\u2019t up to it. The rights and wrongs of using AI in music have been hotly debated and one way you could read Now and Then\u2019s success is as a tacit thumbs-up from the music business for a deeply divisive technology, or at least a hopeful suggestion that it might be a wonderful tool rather than a catastrophe for creativity. You have to admire their optimism.",

        "trailText": "In this week\u2019s newsletter: Lawyers are now involved in the most explosive rap feud of the century. A look at the potential cultural and commercial impact, and how hip-hop became big business",
        "bodyText": "Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. Kendrick Lamar v Drake was already the biggest rap beef of the 21st century \u2013 and then it got legal. This week I spoke with Nels Abbey, Guardian contributor and author of The Hip-Hop MBA: Lessons in Cut-Throat Capitalism from Rap\u2019s Moguls, for his take on Drake\u2019s legal action against Universal Music Group (UMG) and Spotify. He argues that to understand this latest development, you need a business lesson on how the hip-hop industry became what it is today. Let\u2019s get into it, after the roundup. Weekly roundup Ghana\u2019s new old president | John Dramani Mahama, who was president of Ghana from 2012 to 2017, has won a historic comeback election victory, after voters ousted the incumbent New Patriotic Party in rebuke of its management of the country\u2019s deepening economic crisis. France withdraws from Chad | France has begun recalling its military assets from Chad, as its influence wanes across its former colonies in Africa. As west Africa correspondent Eromo Egbejule reports, this follows the expulsion of French diplomats, banning of French media and withdrawal of troops in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Jay-Z accused of rape in US lawsuit | Jay-Z has been named alongside Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs in a lawsuit alleging that the pair raped a 13-year-old girl after the MTV video music awards in 2000. Jay-Z denied the allegations on social media, dismissing the lawsuit as a \u201cblackmail attempt\u201d. Black patients less likely to survive stem cell transplants | Ethnic minority cancer patients from all backgrounds face an increased risk of fatal complications after donor stem cell transplants in the UK. As UK health and inequalities correspondent Tobi Thomas reports, a study found that \u201cthere was a higher risk of death in the 100 days after the transplant for Black and Asian patients compared with white patients\u201d. Poetry slam resurgence in Africa | Young Francophone Africans across west and central Africa are packing out poetry slams, as performers find an outlet for their disenchantment with military coups, rising unemployment and a worsening cost of living crisis. In depth: a generational rap beef If you want the scene-by-scene play of how the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat developed, you can read this explainer, but what matters most is Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us, which is the subject of Drake\u2019s legal action. It became a viral sensation when it was released in May, debuting at No 1 in the US, definitively crowning Lamar as winner of the feud and immediately becoming a staple of global Black nightlife. Where previously we\u2019d finish parties on an electric slide to Cameo\u2019s Candy, Not Like Us was seeing us out the dance, with people rapping every bar. Drake, who had boasted about his mammoth commercial size and status as an international hitmaker, was now the victim of a track that set several Spotify streaming records and had global reach. But Drake had not only seemingly lost in the cultural sense; the beef also represented a business failure. His supposed preferential standing within music labels had been a source of bravado for him \u2013 on the track Push Ups he taunted Lamar about his alleged 50% contract split with his former label Top Dawg Entertainment, which Lamar had left in 2022. But now, at their shared parent company UMG (Lamar and Drake are signed to UMG subsidiary labels Interscope and Republic, respectively), Lamar has come out on top. A deeper story on the business of hip-hop has begun to emerge. \u201cCompetition has helped decide practically everything in hip-hop, from who\u2019s going to be the bestseller, or even who gets to go first on a song,\u201d Nels Abbey says. It\u2019s crucial here to zoom in to examine the different types of competition in different industries. You have oligopolies, where a few large companies dominate the industry \u2013 Abbey provides the example of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo sharing about 70% of the US soft drinks market. Then you have monopolies, where just one company dominates an industry. And then you have \u201cmonopolistic competition\u201d \u2013 where many companies may be selling the same base product but with significant differences, say hair salons or clothing stores. Abbey classes hip-hop as a \u201cmonopolistic industry\u201d. Lamar and Drake are not interchangeable entities \u2013 while they are both rappers, they are incredibly different as artists. Drake is \u201cthe ladies\u2019 man, the party guy, a bit introspective sometimes\u201d, whereas Lamar is \u201cconscious rap, much more lyrically dense, more of a hip-hop purist\u201d. On paper, they\u2019re not natural competitors as, despite previous collaborations, they occupy different lanes. But as Abbey explains, hip-hop has not historically taken the monopolistic approach: \u201cGoing all the way back to Death Row and Bad Boy Records, right the way to Drake and Kendrick now, hip-hop often operates like cut-throat oligopolies, competing for market share, so quite intense.\u201d For Abbey, hip-hop artists\u2019 backgrounds of economic deprivation, gang wars and rivalry, both local and continent-wide, mean that \u201csomething that should be a business competition becomes intensely personal, almost as if they try to destroy each other as people\u201d. You saw it with Eazy-E v Dr Dre, and Biggie v Tupac. \u201cThat personal diss track of course becomes a record,\u201d Abbey says, and record sales then add another layer of competition. *** How big record labels took over hip-hop What does it mean for record labels themselves to be involved in this competition, where a rap beef culminates in litigation? For Abbey, this requires digging into how hip-hop became big business. \u201cIn the beginning, big record labels didn\u2019t view hip-hop as real music, which created a lane for small independent businesspeople to occupy and cultivate hip-hop into an industry.\u201d Early hip-hop in the late 1970s was managed by executives such as Sylvia Robinson, whose Sugar Hill Records created the Sugarhill Gang and later signed Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. In the next decade, big record labels finally caught on to the profit potential. They approached and signed rappers such as Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, who \u201csold massive records, but lacked cultural credibility \u2013 meaning that if you\u2019re trying to create an empire in this business, when you find one person, you want to be able to attract more talent,\u201d Abbey says. The problem big labels found was that \u201cyoung talent coming from the hood don\u2019t want to be the next MC Hammer or Vanilla Ice, they wanted to be an Ice Cube or an Eazy-E, so they were still running to independents because they wanted to be like the people they looked up to\u201d. But then, in the 90s, deregulation of the music industry led to the emergence of big entertainment conglomerates. As a result, Abbey says, \u201csmall hip-hop record labels started to get purchased or do big deals with those big labels. Universal [UMG] purchased Def Jam and Interscope, which owned Death Row Records. That\u2019s pretty much how they became the market leaders today, and how all these independent hip-hop executives such as Russell Simmons became wealthy people.\u201d (Simmons sold his share of Def Jam for $120m in 1998.) But for those labels that resisted being bought out, bigger labels would use their financial power to crowd them out of the market. As Abbey explains, hip-hop music videos in that era transformed from being \u201chood focused\u201d to featuring images of luxury \u2013 the Hamptons, helicopters and private jets. Take Notorious BIG\u2019s Hypnotize or Busta Rhymes\u2019s What\u2019s It Gonna Be?!. Major TV stations couldn\u2019t resist broadcasting the blockbuster-like productions, and \u201cthe small independents who didn\u2019t have the money to make those big videos struggled to get their videos on air\u201d. As money flooded into hip-hop, from music videos to payola, \u201cit was effectively over for the little man\u201d. *** Kendrick v Drake \u2013 what makes a winner? So, back to Kendrick v Drake. In 2021, Drake signed what was described as a \u201cLeBron-sized deal\u201d with UMG. As Abbey stresses, no one knows the details, but it is rumoured to be in the hundreds of millions (he rapped \u201c500 million just for Aubrey\u201d on Major Distribution). It could require him to meet certain sales figures or other performance indicators to access the full sum, and there could be a clawback clause to recuperate money already paid if these aren\u2019t met. What we do know is that Drake and Lamar are both signed to labels owned by UMG. Abbey emphasises that UMG is not a monolithic entity: \u201cIt\u2019s a vast entertainment block where you may have different silos where people might even have issues with each other. We can\u2019t forget the role of competition even within UMG \u2013 these executives are going to be competing with each other.\u201d Now, the norm for a record label whose artist is engaged in a generational rap beef would be to throw all resources behind the artist to ensure the beef is won, since \u201cit helps create soft power for the label, makes them more credible in the actual business, and it helps them attract talent, too\u201d. That\u2019s how it happened during the early 2000s beef between Nelly and KRS-One, which has parallels with Drake v Lamar, the pop star versus the pure hip-hop vanguard. In that beef, Nelly won, as Universal Records were able to drown out KRS-One\u2019s diss track Ova Here by pushing Nelly\u2019s Roc the Mic (remix), where he mockingly raps that the \u201cold man should get a rapper\u2019s pension\u201d (KRS-One later described Universal as \u201can oppressor\u201d). But if both artists are under the same conglomerate, surely that would imply label neutrality, particularly in a monopolistic industry where there\u2019s presumably little benefit from one eliminating the other? Well, this is the entire basis of Drake\u2019s legal filing: he is claiming that UMG and Spotify conspired to artificially inflate streams of Not Like Us while suppressing his own music, and he\u2019s shaping up to sue for defamation on the basis that Lamar\u2019s lyrics accused him of child sexual abuse, which he strongly denies. While Drake has been ridiculed for diminishing rap beef by running to the courts, it is odd that UMG would permit such lyrics considering the reputational risk. And this is where Drake\u2019s allegations against UMG, if true, may not just be poor sportsmanship. As Abbey explains: \u201cSpotify, like every streaming company, has a fixed rate for songs in terms of share of profit Spotify gives to the label and therefore the artist. Drake claims that Spotify and UMG reduced the rate the label will receive on Not Like Us, meaning that Spotify were effectively incentivised to boost the song to receive a greater degree of profits.\u201d Drake\u2019s allegations against UMG suggest that it effectively helped to sabotage one of its biggest assets, threatening his career and continuing commercial viability. A spokesperson for UMG said last month that the suggestion that it would \u201cdo anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue\u201d. All in all, if the aim of a rap beef is to destroy your opponent, Lamar may have achieved that goal. And, regardless of what camp you\u2019re in, the feud does raise some important questions. Drake is, of course, by no measure the little guy in a David and Goliath scenario. And we can\u2019t be certain of the impact on his career until he drops a new project, or of the credibility of his legal action until more details emerge. But, in the timeline of rap beefs and competition in hip-hop, money has always worked harder and faster than any pen could. \u2022 Nels Abbey\u2019s book The Hip-Hop MBA: Lessons in Cut-Throat Capitalism from Rap\u2019s Moguls is out now.

        "bodyText": "1. Gillian Welch &amp; David Rawlings: Woodland (Acony, August) Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\u2019s return was prompted by the near loss of their life\u2019s work when a hurricane damaged Woodland, the folk duo\u2019s recording studio. That averted destruction was mirrored in these beautifully arranged, woebegone tales of empty freight trains and departed friends. 2. Jpegmafia: I Lay Down My Life for You (Awal, August) How to follow Scaring the Hoes, Jpegmafia\u2019s 2023 caustic outing with Danny Brown? With this dizzying collision of hooks, samples, metal guitars and disdain. Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks\u2019s uranium-tongued collection found space for self-reflection too. 3. Charli xcx: Brat (Atlantic, June) Pop\u2019s premier left-field auteur finally received her mainstream kudos thanks to this inescapable album-cum-phenomenon. This acid green collection of 15 dancefloor-facing tracks (and its starry remix album) threw out attitude and vulnerability in heroic succession. 4. Shabaka: Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace (Impulse!, April) Flutes have had a resurgence, thanks to erstwhile OutKast rapper Andre 3000 in 2023 and Shabaka Hutchings, whose saxophone has had an outsized impact on the last decade of hip UK jazz. This very personal outing on shakuhachi (Japanese flute) and clarinet indicated that serenity comes from blowing up your USP. 5. Floating Points: Cascade (Ninja Tune, September) Sam Shepherd\u2019s last opus was 2021\u2019s Promises, featuring the LSO and the last recordings of Pharoah Sanders. Recorded during downtime from scoring a ballet, Cascade marked a return to slapping club music, a gossamer set that reaffirmed this polymath\u2019s dancefloor prowess. 6. Kim Deal: Nobody Loves You More (4AD, November) Pixies bassist, Breeders mainstay, Olivia Rodrigo inspirer and now solo artist Kim Deal took 12 years to make this album, which also featured her ally, late engineer Steve Albini. Few artists can meld pop sweetness and gnarly guitar as sublimely as Deal, whose songs spanned everything from her mother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s to disobedience. 7. Cassie Kinoshi\u2019s Seed: Gratitude (International Anthem, March) Of all the terrific UK jazz records this year \u2013 pace, Nala Sinephro, Ezra Collective and Nubya Garcia \u2013 this outing from composer Cassie Kinoshi departed furthest from her Tomorrow\u2019s Warrior peers. Mostly recorded live with her 18-piece ensemble, Seed, plus strings from the London Contemporary Orchestra, Gratitude was a sweeping, old-school orchestral score emphasising self-care. 8. Sophie: Sophie (Transgressive/Future Classic, September) Hyperpop producer Sophie\u2019s third album was almost finished when she tragically fell to her death in 2021. Completed by her brother, Sophie captures an artist working on the cusp of punishing experimentation and out-and-out pop. What Sophie might lack in cohesion it makes up in singular sound design and eclectic self-assurance. 9. Kendrick Lamar: GNX (PGLang/Interscope, November) Pulitzer prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar has long struggled with fame and his place in hip-hop\u2019s pantheon. His war of words with Drake this summer seemed to settle the matter, making GNX an erudite flex that leaned hard on bopping productions and retro samples while retaining all the rigour of Lamar\u2019s dense, deep-dive lyricism. 10. Shovel Dance Collective: The Shovel Dance (American Dreams, October) A number of silvery artists have reinvented folk of late; the nine-person British experimental Shovel Dance Collective are another revelation. Traditionals such as The Merry Golden Tree revisited the story of a betrayed cabin boy with tensile emotion and minimal drones while Four Loom Weaver was a portrait of grinding poverty rendered in breathtaking a cappella.",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight. I don\u2019t think she hates to say it at all. LS",

        "trailText": "Clearly neither rapper had anything to do with this deep dive into their famous feud \u2013 and it makes for a refreshing alternative to hip-hop hagiography",
        "bodyText": "The sky isn\u2019t as blue, the grass not so green, food now tastes like sawdust and life just hasn\u2019t been as sweet, since rap superstars Kendrick Lamar and Drake ceased their epic beefing back in May. So it is with gratitude that we hip-hop heads receive this hour-long documentary rehash. It doesn\u2019t go deep into the music itself, a total of 10 tracks \u2013 five from Lamar, five from Drake \u2013 released between 22 March and 5 May of this year. But there are numerous TikTok explainer videos for that. Rather, Public Enemies works by paralleling the biographies of both artists, to cast light on the present state of hip-hop, the music industry and the culture at large. These men were born within months of each other, but while Kendrick Lamar Duckworth grew up amid the poverty, gang activity and racist police brutality of 1990s Compton, LA (cue some pumping NWA on the soundtrack), Aubrey Drake Graham was a son of the suburbs. The Toronto suburbs, to be exact, where he was born to a white Jewish mother and a Black American father and raised as one of few kids of colour in a majority-white, Jewish community. The proof of this is home video footage of a pre-growth-spurt Aubrey, complete with Coke-bottle glasses and braces on his teeth, rapping at a barmitzvah. The fact that we\u2019re even seeing this, courtesy of some of Aubrey\u2019s preppy-looking so-called pals, is our first clue that this is very much the unauthorised biography. Clearly neither rapper, nor any member of their inner circle, was anywhere near this production. But if you\u2019re sick of the usual hagiographies \u2013 even when partially disguised by Lego, as in Pharrell Williams\u2019s new one \u2013 maybe that\u2019s no bad thing? Instead, we hear from people such as the seventh grade English teacher who encouraged young Lamar\u2019s poetic talents, and who offers some sense of the traumatising effects of US gun violence (\u201cI\u2019ve lost 32 students. I\u2019ve been to 19 funerals.\u201d) And the Canadian TV producer who turned Drake into a teen idol by casting him in the high school soap, Degrassi: The Next Generation. She talks about something that\u2019s also evident in those barmitzvah bops: Drake\u2019s precocious confidence. The key thing here is not just the different class and racial contexts of their upbringings, but the different mindsets each brought to the game. Drake was an already famous heart-throb \u2013 or Certified Lover Boy, if you prefer \u2013 with his eyes on the prize of global stardom. Lamar was grinding away in relative obscurity, but embedded in one of hip-hop\u2019s historic proving grounds, and steadily honing his craft. As with all the bitterest rivalries, they also started off as friends. At least, in 2012, Drake invited Lamar to support him on tour and endorsed the then-less-famous rapper\u2019s second album. A straight exchange of popularity for credibility, perhaps? Or an early example of that \u201cculture vulture\u201d thing Drake does: swooping in to global rap scenes to become, according to his most prominent critic, \u201cnot a colleague\u201d but a \u201ccoloniser\u201d. It would have been interesting to get more into the British iteration of this phenomenon, from Drake\u2019s patronage of Top Boy to his cringey \u201cgirls-dem\u201d pronunciation on J Hus\u2019s Who Told You, and the Lamar lyrics graffitied on his Carnaby Street OVO store. But Public Enemies only superficially acknowledges the creatively generative power of rap rivalries in general. Maybe this is all just a distraction from the harrowing conflicts that have truly characterised 2024 \u2013 such as Elon Musk v democracy or western imperialism v Palestinian lives. But if we\u2019re gonna get into it, let\u2019s really get into it: who does the \u201cus\u201d of Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us exclude? What does it say about changing masculine ideals that many of the insults revolved around paternal responsibility? And can you feature on a Taylor Swift single and still hold your head up in the hood? Sometimes this documentary seems more about applying salve to Drake\u2019s third-degree burns, with XXL magazine\u2019s former editor-in-chief Elliott Wilson proving a particularly soothing battlefield nurse. He reiterates Drake\u2019s overall contribution and points out that the charge of inauthenticity is always levelled at hip-hop artists who don\u2019t fit the mould: not Black enough, not American enough, not street enough. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s warranted. His point is well taken. But then the Not Like Us beat hits and \u2013 sorry to this man \u2013 it\u2019s all over. \u2022 Public Enemies: Kendrick vs Drake is on Channel 4",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 is out in front with the nominations for the 67th Grammy awards in what promises to be another female-heavy year. The star has scored 11 nods for her country album Cowboy Carter with recognition in the country, pop and Americana categories. It\u2019s the biggest number of nominations she has received in a single year and she now holds the joint record of most-nominated artist ever alongside her husband, Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 is also the most awarded artist in Grammys history with 32 wins, yet has not won album of the year to date. In that category she faces competition from Andr\u00e9 3000, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Jacob Collier, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift. Following Beyonc\u00e9 with seven nominations each are Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish. Then with six each is Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. Breakout star Roan continues a highly successful year and will be one of the favourites in the new artist category alongside Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, Khruangbin, Raye, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims. The record of the year category contains The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2018Em, Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso, Charli xcx \u2013 360, Kendrick Lemar \u2013 Not Like Us, Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck Babe and Taylor Swift and Post Malone \u2013 Fortnight.

The dance categories also saw recognition for Justice, Troye Sivan and Disclosure while the rock categories were led by The Black Keys and Green Day. The controversial star Chris Brown, who was the subject of a new documentary detailing various allegations of abuse and sexual assault, was featured prominently in the R&amp;B categories alongside Muni Long and Lucky Daye. Lamar was the most-nominated rap artist and faces competition in those categories from Eminem and J Cole. Dolly Parton, Jimmy Carter and Barbra Streisand also feature in the unusual line-up for this year\u2019s audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais are featured in the comedy album line-up. The recording academy\u2019s CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, called music a \u201cpowerful force for good\u201d in his introduction to today\u2019s announcement. The awards are voted on by a body of 13,000 members. No new categories were added for the first time in four years. Earlier this year, Taylor Swift became the first artist to win album of the year for the fourth time, taking home the award for Midnights. The 67th Grammy awards will take place on 2 February 2025 with a host for the ceremony yet to be announced.",

        "trailText": "Singer scores 13th chart-topper with Valentine\u2019s Day edition of her live album Lover (Live from Paris)",
        "bodyText": "Taylor Swift has broken Madonna\u2019s record as the female artist with the most No 1 albums in the UK, as her new live album Lover (Live From Paris) becomes her 13th chart-topper. It means she draws level with Elvis Presley as the international artist with the most No 1s. Still outpacing her are the Rolling Stones with 14, then Robbie Williams and the Beatles, joint top with 15. Featuring performances from the studio album of the same name, Lover (Live from Paris) is Swift\u2019s fourth live album, and the first to reach No 1. It was originally released in limited quantities for Valentine\u2019s Day in 2023, and reached No 90, but 47,000 sales of a new heart-shaped double vinyl version \u2013 the latest of the ever more elaborate and numerous physical editions of Swift albums \u2013 took it to the top. It\u2019s the biggest opening week for an album this year. Lover (Live from Paris) has never been released on streaming services as a whole album (though its tracks are individually available), and it\u2019s rare to get a No 1 album without streams. In fact, the last person to do it was Taylor Swift. Eight years ago she released Reputation, and got to No 1 solely from sales of the album, before putting it on streaming a few weeks later. It took Swift until her fourth album, 2012\u2019s Red, to score her first UK No 1, and her tally has since been helped by her project to rerecord her albums, with new versions of Fearless, Red, Speak Now and 1989 all topping the chart. Fans are now anticipating the last in this series, Reputation. Swift, however, may be enjoying some time off after her Eras tour, which became \u2013 by some distance \u2013 the highest-grossing concert tour of all time when it concluded in December. In at No 2 in this week\u2019s chart are rock band Inhaler, fronted by Bono\u2019s son Elijah Hewson, with their third album Open Wide. Kendrick Lamar jumps back into the Top 3 from No 31, buoyed up by the physical release of his album GNX and his much-discussed Super Bowl half-time show. The Super Bowl also propelled Lamar\u2019s Drake diss track Not Like Us up the singles chart to No 2, the highest placing for any Lamar track, though Lola Young\u2019s Messy remains at the top for a fourth week. The five Grammy awards won by Not Like Us will have helped its chart performance, and other Grammy winners have experienced a boost. Best new artist winner Chappell Roan\u2019s Pink Pony Club reaches a new high of No 4, while Benson Boone\u2019s former No 1 Beautiful Things vaults up to No 6 off the back of his acrobatic viral performance of the song at the awards. Doechii\u2019s Denial Is a River was another much-shared performance, and the track becomes her first Top 10 hit, at No 9.",

        "trailText": "Global chart dominated by US acts including Benson Boone, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Sabrina Carpenter, with K-pop bands also strong",
        "bodyText": "British pop stars have failed to reach the worldwide annual charts of the year\u2019s Top 10 biggest singles and albums for the first time in more than two decades. In 2022, UK acts such as Harry Styles and Glass Animals made up seven of the 20 entries in the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) list. This year, the leading UK act was producer and singer Artemas, for I Like the Way You Kiss Me. British stars such as Charli xcx \u2013 arguably the most conversation-dominating UK act of 2024, with her album Brat \u2013 Dua Lipa and Coldplay did not feature. It is the first time since 2003 that a UK act hasn\u2019t featured in either the singles or albums list. The No 1 song globally was Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, and the No 1 album globally was The Tortured Poets Department by Taylor Swift. K-pop boybands dominated the albums list, with two entries from Seventeen (Spill the Feels at No 6 and 17 Is Right Here at No 8), along with Enhypen (Romance: Untold at No 4) and Stray Kids (ATE at No 10). The remainder of the list came from US superstars: Hit Me Hard and Soft by Billie Eilish (No 2), Short n\u2019 Sweet by Sabrina Carpenter (No 3), SOS by SZA (No 5), One Thing at a Time by Morgan Wallen (No 7) and Stick Season by Noah Kahan (No 9). In the singles chart, only Irish songwriter Hozier, with Too Sweet at No 6, deviated from the otherwise total US dominance of the list, which spanned pop (Carpenter\u2019s Espresso at No 2) to rap-country (Post Malone and Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help at No 7) and a five-year-old song by Swift, Cruel Summer, at No 9. The insistence of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s blockbuster Drake diss track, Not Like Us, was confirmed as it appeared at No 8. Jo Twist, chief executive of British record industry body the BPI, told the BBC: \u201cBritish artists may have enjoyed stronger years on the international stage, which perhaps isn\u2019t surprising given some of our biggest names were not in cycle in 2024. \u201cThere was still plenty to be excited about, as a new generation announced itself \u2013 not least Charli xcx, who enjoyed a breakthrough year globally, alongside international chart success for emerging artists such as Jordan Adetunji, Artemas and Good Neighbours, while the likes of Lola Young and Myles Smith are now rapidly building an international following.\u201d Twist said that it is \u201cundoubtedly becoming much harder to break talent in a hyper-competitive global music economy\u201d. The news comes ahead of the Brit awards this weekend, led by xcx with five nominations for Brat, followed by Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith with four.

        "trailText": "Can the Chiefs pull off a three-peat? Who is the halftime performer? Will Trump\u2019s NFL appearance be met with applause? We (mostly) have the answers",
        "bodyText": "The biggest game of the year in US sports takes place on Sunday. We\u2019re here to answer all your questions (or the ones we came up with anyway). Let\u2019s get the simple stuff out the way first. Who is playing in the Super Bowl? This year\u2019s Super Bowl \u2013 or Super Bowl LIX for NFL brand evangelists and fans of Roman numerals \u2013 will be between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. You may be familiar with the Chiefs\u2019 body of work: this is their fifth Super Bowl appearance in six seasons, and a victory would be their third championship in a row, something no NFL team has achieved before. In short, they\u2019re really good. The Eagles, meanwhile, are in their third Super Bowl in seven seasons, thanks in large part to the genius-level intellect of their general manager, Howie Roseman. In short, they\u2019re also really good. When will the Chiefs and Eagles kickoff? The game starts on Sunday 9 February at 5.30pm local time in New Orleans, which is 6.30pm on the US east coast, 3.30pm on the west coast, 11.30pm in the UK and 10.30am on Monday in Sydney. And where can I watch or stream it? Unsurprisingly, the game is sold out but tickets are on resale for as, ahem, little as $2,800. A slightly cheaper option is watching it on TV. Fox is this year\u2019s broadcaster in the US, with the main analyst being Tom Brady, who won seven Super Bowls himself during his playing career. Spanish language viewers have two options: Fox Deportes and Telemundo. In Canada, the game is on TSN and CTV; in Britain you can watch on ITV1 and Sky Sports; and in Australia you can catch it on the Seven Network and ESPN. Where will it be played? The Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints, will host the game. The NFL tends to choose warm weather cities as hosts to avoid fans freezing during the game. But northern cities do occasionally get the Super Bowl \u2013 the distinctly untropical Minneapolis was given the nod in 2018 \u2013 but in those cases they\u2019re nearly always played in indoor stadiums. Do teams ever play the Super Bowl in their own stadium? Host cities are chosen years in advance, so while teams can end up playing in their own stadium, it\u2019s rare. Only two teams, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams, have won the Super Bowl in their own stadium. Right now, the Saints are what NFL experts refer to as a Very Bad Team \u2013 they did not make the playoffs this season. Which celebrities will be at the game? Just in case you\u2019re one of the eight people on the planet who don\u2019t know this, Chiefs star Travis Kelce is Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriend. She\u2019ll almost certainly be at the game, and the cameras will cut to her every 39 seconds or so. Last year, some on the US right believed the game would be fixed to ensure a Chiefs/Kelce/Swift victory in order to give Joe Biden an advantage in the presidential election. The conspiracy did not quite work out as planned. In other good-looking people news, Bradley Cooper is a hardcore Eagles fan and is more than likely to be at the game. Paul Rudd, a longtime Chiefs fan, was at last year\u2019s game and is likely to attend this year too. But there are a lot of complimentary tickets to the Super Bowl, so expect plenty more celebs. So the game will unite a divided America? Yeah \u2026 sure. Donald Trump is set to become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. And because we haven\u2019t heard enough from him of late, he\u2019ll sit down for a no doubt measured and conciliatory interview that will be broadcast before the game on Fox. What kind of reception will Trump get? Trump is a big sports fan. He has been cheered at college football games but was booed and greeted with chants of \u201clock him up\u201d when he appeared at the 2019 World Series in his first term as president. The Super Bowl will be played in a Democratic city in a Republican state in front of fans from all over America, so the most likely reaction is cheers and boos when he appears on screen. Somewhat surprisingly, given that Trump once wrote \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT\u201d on social media, Kelce says it will be an honor to play in front of the president. Will this affect the rumored proposal Kelce has prepared for Swift after the game? It may! Although Kelce pushed back on those rumors earlier in the week when he was asked if he intended to give Swift a ring after the game. \u201cA Super Bowl ring? Next question,\u201d he said. Who are the players to watch? The Chiefs have the best player on the planet, Patrick Mahomes, at quarterback. A win on Sunday would be his fourth Super Bowl title, putting him on track to break Brady\u2019s record of seven and threaten the former Patriots star as the greatest quarterback of all time. Mahomes does not roll out as many breathtaking throws as he once did, but the 29-year-old nearly always makes the right decision and is best when the pressure is on, which is pretty useful in the biggest game of the season. The Chiefs also have a brilliant defense, masterminded by defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. The Eagles are led by running back Saquon Barkley, who joined them from their rivals, the New York Giants in the offseason, and promptly had one of the best rushing seasons of all time. The Eagles also have a formidable defense and arguably the deepest and best roster in the entire NFL. Who is doing the half-time show? Bad news for Drake if he wants to watch: Kendrick Lamar will be performing at half-time (he also appeared at the 2022 Super Bowl). Louisiana native Jon Batiste will sing the national anthem. Who is the favorite to win the Super Bowl? The Chiefs are the betting favorites, which is not a huge surprise considering they\u2019re the two-time reigning champs, have been to seven straight AFC Championships, won nine straight AFC west division titles and have lost just twice all season. But they also won a lot of tight games they could easily have lost, although some point out the fact that they do so with monotonous regularity shows they\u2019re good rather than lucky. The Eagles also have a deeper roster, which gives them the edge for many pundits. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2025 to remove a suggestion that Taylor Swift endorsed Joe Biden in 2024. She endorsed Kamala Harris on 10 September 2024.",

        "bodyText": "Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. It was a big week in Brazil, where Black Consciousness Day on 20 November was a public holiday for the first time. I spoke to Tiago Rogero, our South America correspondent, about the significance of the day and the big changes happening in Brazil\u2019s approach to race. But first, the weekly roundup. Weekly roundup Ghana\u2019s illegal gold-mining boom | Our west Africa correspondent, Eromo Egbejule, reports on how the illegal mining trade in Ghana is wreaking environmental devastation, causing muddied rivers and huge craters, as well as the loss of an estimated $2bn in annual tax revenues due to more than a million people being employed in the informal mining sector. Fertility \u2018miracle\u2019 rocks Nigeria | The BBC World Service has investigated a cryptic pregnancy scam in Nigeria, in which fraudsters convince vulnerable women to pay for an expensive \u201cmiracle fertility treatment\u201d supposedly guaranteed to get them pregnant. One woman says she was led to believe she had given birth after being pregnant for 15 months. Band Aid backlash | As Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure\u2019s charity supergroup Band Aid is revamped and rereleased for its 40th anniversary, critics are again expressing frustration over the patronising lyrics, stereotyping of Africans and distraction from questions about economic justice. The author Nels Abbey argues that Band Aid has \u201cturned out to be a western soft power coup and an assault on Africa\u201d. Gabriel Moses designs Brit award trophy | The British-Nigerian artist was revealed as the designer for the 2025 Brit award trophy. Moses, who has collaborated with the likes of Skepta, A$AP Rocky and Tems, joins an alumni of Black Brit award designers including Olaolu Slawn, Yinka Ilori and the architect David Adjaye. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise drop | The West Coast rapper has surprised fans with the unannounced release of a 12-track album. With production by Jack Antonoff and contributions from SZA and Roddy Rich, GNX rounds off a year in which Lamar released three diss tracks against his former Poetic Justice collaborator Drake. And, in the latest plot twist, Drake has begun legal action against Universal Music Group, accusing the label of artificially inflating streams of Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us. In depth: A long history of Afro-Brazilian resistance Black Consciousness Day goes back as far as the 1960s in Brazil. But the movement behind it has a much longer history with origins in the bloody resistance to slavery in the country. It was informally celebrated on 13 May, the day slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888. In 1972 the date was changed to honour the death of Brazil\u2019s most famous resistance leader, Zumbi, who was killed by Portuguese colonial forces on 20 November 1695. When Black Consciousness Day was centred on the abolition of slavery it was bittersweet, Tiago tells me. \u201cAll the celebrations used to focus on the white princes who signed the abolition. So in the 1970s, a group of students decided to establish a date to counter the one in May.\u201d The establishment of the day as a nationwide public holiday for the first time is, Tiago says, \u201cthe result of the struggle of the Black movement\u201d over the past five decades. Today, the date is one where a thriving grassroots network of groups that form the Black movement in the country come together to play music, dance and hold educational events to boost pride and connection with Brazil\u2019s Black heritage. But it is also an opportunity to make broader political demands. Alongside Afro-themed parades, capoeira circles, samba extravaganzas and art exhibitions, a march in S\u00e3o Paulo celebrated the public holiday and supported calls for an end to the six-day working week. *** \u2018We are a majority Black country\u2019 The first publicly observed Black Consciousness Day is a breakthrough, Tiago says, but it is also a culmination of many years of social progress. In the early 00s, affirmative action integrated more Black people in higher education, resulting in a burst of activism that became focused on November. \u201cAll of November is our unofficial Black consciousness month \u2013 and 20 November is the cherry on top,\u201d he adds. This year there were 38 activities in S\u00e3o Paulo alone that day. \u201cIn November, the TV channels and newspapers remember that we are a majority Black country.\u201d TV Globo \u2013 Brazil\u2019s biggest TV channel and the most watched in Latin America \u2013 gave Black Consciousness Day a prime spot this year. \u201cSoap operas are a huge thing here,\u201d Tiago says, \u201cand after the main soap opera, there was a 50-minute special about Black Consciousness Day that focused on Black people who are arrested wrongfully based on photo recognition, which is a huge problem.\u201d *** Not everyone wants to celebrate Despite the celebrations, the day is still \u201ca [powerful] demonstration of how Brazil is divided; there is still a lot of resistance and backlash\u201d, Tiago says. Every 20 November, there is criticism from the far right \u2013 and even \u201cthe average Brazilian\u201d \u2013 who claim \u201ctalking about racism brings more racism and that \u2018Brazil is not a racist country\u2019\u201d. This commonly held view becomes more \u201caggressive\u201d in November, Tiago says, especially amid the growing backlash over the fact that, in Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil has a \u201cprogressive president who has been important for the Black movement\u201d. This year, one mayor refused to comply with the law and did not observe the national holiday. I suggest to Tiago that this appears to be a contradictory situation, one where there is an incredible legacy of Black resistance and a vast population of African descent \u2013 the largest outside Africa, in fact \u2013 but even the most basic conversation about racism has not begun. Tiago agrees, and attributes this to Brazil\u2019s unique history and specific type of racism, one that is rarely expressed publicly but manifested through prejudice and discrimination. \u201cUnlike the US and South Africa, Brazil did not have segregationist laws \u2013 yet segregation here happens on a daily basis. In every single socioeconomic indicator, Black people occupy the worst positions: violence, education, health. At the same time, if you look at who runs the companies and who is in Congress, it is mostly white people.\u201d Tiago says Brazilians will not be openly racist in most cases, only in private spaces. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to talk about racism because we always face arguments that Black people are still the ones trying to divide the country. It\u2019s weird and difficult to compare to other countries,\u201d Tiago says. \u201cWe have made so many advances\u201d but are still so far from achieving equality. He says the most heartbreaking thing is that \u201ca lot of Black people in Brazil still believe that talking about race only makes things worse. They think this way because of history, the media, and the money [used for propaganda] that help feed into this idea.\u201d *** An inevitable march towards progress I ask Tiago if Black Consciousness Day is part of a pattern that over time will make Brazil appear, and think of itself, as a country with a large and increasing Black population, or if such a step will be challenging because the elites and establishment are not Black. \u201cThis is already happening,\u201d Tiago says, adding that more needs to be done to achieve equality. In the meantime, he points to the importance of fighting against a sense of alienation, something I found so moving. Even as someone who has never visited Brazil, I immediately recognised what can only be described as an atmosphere of dispossession. Which is why Black Consciousness Day and its associated events are so crucial \u2013 they lay claim to public spaces. Tiago lays that claim through Black walks, a growing cultural movement of strolling through the Black areas in your town. These are physical and metaphorical steps of reclamation: \u201cWe fight for the right to feel comfortable in our own skin, our own cities, in our own country. We are the ones who literally built this country and we should be the ones who own it.\u201d What we\u2019re into In my early teens, I was big into hip-hop and downloading mixtapes off DatPiff (if you know, you know). So I was so ecstatic when J Cole\u2019s 2009 mixtape, The Warm Up, finally dropped on streaming platforms last Friday. A true classic. Jason I stumbled on the AlMultaqa Chamber Orchestra, an Afro-Arab ensemble based in the United Arab Emirates that merges musical influences that land in my sweet spot. But the range of genres the orchestra plays is what is amazing. Check it out here. Nesrine These images from the Africa Foto Fair, held in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, are a visual treat. I particularly love Taiwo Aina\u2019s shot of a female boxer and Gus Sarkodee\u2019s exploration of musicianship. Jason Stop splashing out on pricey protein bars and boil and season some lupin beans instead. I used to buy these on the roadside in Sudan but have finally mastered how to make them at home. Though it\u2019s a long process, they make the perfect high-protein snack. You\u2019ll be hooked, I promise. Nesrine Black catalogue Last weekend I spoke at the Cambridge literary festival on a panel celebrating the centenary of James Baldwin\u2019s birth. Before we began, a clip from the Giovanni\u2019s Room author\u2019s legendary 1965 Cambridge Union debate against the conservative pro-segregationist William F Buckley was screened, which Baldwin won by a landslide majority with 544 votes versus 164. His distinction as a stylish orator, with singular moral clarity and the most admirable poise and elegance in the face of a political adversary, makes this an engrossing watch almost 60 years later. Take a look at the debate here. Jason Tap in Do you have any thoughts or responses to this week\u2019s newsletter?

        "headline": "The gig economy: ticket inflation is getting worse, so where does all the money go?",
        "trailText": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour and the Gallaghers\u2019 ill-fated dabble with dynamic pricing have put the spotlight on how much we\u2019re willing to pay for live music. But, on the other side of the equation, the costs can be exorbitant and the risks are eye-watering",
        "bodyText": "The news that Oasis were to reunite sparked a wave of euphoria across the nation at the end of last summer. But the nostalgia balloon was quickly punctured by the discovery that the tickets, initially priced at \u00a3148.50, had suddenly leapt to \u00a3355.20 due to dynamic pricing. The outcry quickly sparked a new debate about what constitutes a \u201cfair\u201d price for gig tickets, with the band themselves fanning the flames: Liam Gallagher told those bellyaching about the lack of transparency to \u201cSHUTUP\u201d and buy \u201cKneeling only\u201d tickets for \u00a3100,000 instead. Dynamic pricing, where the cost rises in real time in lockstep with demand, is hardly new. Parallels are often made with the surge pricing used on budget airlines and taxi-booking apps, although in the case of gig tickets, dynamic pricing means the price can rise in the few seconds it takes for consumers to complete their booking. Bruce Springsteen was caught up in the issue in 2022 for his US tour, as were huge acts such as Beyonc\u00e9, Harry Styles, Coldplay and Blackpink for their UK shows. With costs rising across a number of industries and people\u2019s pay packets being squeezed to breaking point, it seems reasonable to ask what truly constitutes a fair price. I spoke to a range of voices across the live music business \u2013 ticketing companies, agents, promoters and artist managers \u2013 to understand not just how prices are set but also what costs need to be covered by gig revenues. Average ticket prices globally rose 23.3% in 2023 to $130.81 (\u00a3104.36), according to data from the live industry trade publication Pollstar, a figure that is almost 10 times the national living wage per hour (currently \u00a311.44 but soon to rise to \u00a312.21). That Pollstar number is, however, heavily skewed at the top end by huge acts charging huge prices for their huge shows. Go down the food chain from Oasis and Taylor Swift, who grossed more than $2bn last year, to mid-sized and smaller acts, and it becomes painfully clear that concert tickets are not the cash bonanza of common presumption. Looking at London, which has the highest concentration of concerts and venues in the UK, tickets at the 5,000-capacity O2 Academy Brixton typically cost between \u00a340 and \u00a350 (before booking fees). A ticket for the 2,300-capacity O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London, can land between \u00a322.85 and \u00a340. A ticket for the 150-capacity Windmill pub in Brixton could be as little as \u00a36 but is rarely over \u00a312. How that revenue is broken down is complex, but the act you are paying to see only ever sees a fraction of that. \u201cTicket prices have barely moved in the 15 years I\u2019ve been doing this, especially on a grassroots level,\u201d says Matt Hanner, founder of booking agency Runway, who looks after emerging acts such as Aussie post-punkers Coldwave, with tickets to see them at the Prince Albert in Brighton in March costing \u00a311.44. Tom Schroeder is EVP of live agency Wasserman Music UK and his roster includes Fred Again and Raye, both of whom are now at, or approaching, arena level. \u201cHaving run 500-capacity and 700-capacity venues myself, the margins are tiny,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, people are losing money.\u201d Phil Hutcheon, founder and CEO of mobile ticketing company Dice, set his company up in part to help smaller acts and independent venues sell more tickets and understands how perilous the economics are. \u201cMid-sized and small concert tickets are actually underpriced for what you get,\u201d he says. \u201cUS tickets are typically 50 to 60% higher than in the UK. The US feels a bit too expensive and in the UK it feels like fans could pay a little more.\u201d A music manager, speaking anonymously, explains that for at least one of their acts, who can play to 1,000 people in London, the cost of all their shows far exceed their fees, even with a minimal crew. At the smallest level, show losses can be substantial as they rarely sell out. \u201cAs a promoter, you can easily lose \u00a31,000 on a 100-capacity gig,\u201d says Hanner. \u201cYou are looking for acts that are going to move through the venues and get to a point where they\u2019re making serious money, which really only happens at 5,000-capacity venues onwards.\u201d When acts get to the arena stage, things don\u2019t suddenly become trouble-free. Overheads rise sharply and that has to be reflected in ticket prices. \u201cOn bigger shows, it\u2019s hard not to spend money on production as the audience has a level of expectation and there\u2019s a level of investment by the artist in having to do that,\u201d says Niamh Byrne, co-founder of Eleven Management, which represents Blur, Gorillaz and Bastille, among others. When spending on huge productions rises, acts will also have to ask for higher guaranteed fees to cover them. (When acts are initially booked, they are offered a fixed fee by the promoter but they may also share in ticket income if the show sells beyond expectations.) Unless arena and stadium shows completely sell out, promoters could still lose money: as the commonly quoted industry figure goes, profits are really only made in the last 10% of ticket sales. As a result, some acts and promoters feel compelled to jack up prices to cover themselves. \u201cFor American acts [playing arenas in the UK], tickets will be well in excess of \u00a3100,\u201d says Ian McAndrew of Wildlife Entertainment, manager of Arctic Monkeys and Fontaines DC. \u201cAmericans generally spend more on production and look for higher margins of profit. They can argue they less commonly come into the country so there\u2019s a premium to see them.\u201d There are exceptions. Paul Heaton\u2019s most recent tour has seen the former Beautiful South man play stripped-back arena shows enabling him to charge \u00a335 a ticket. Most nights sold out and his planned show at the O2 City Hall Newcastle in December was upgraded to the city\u2019s much larger Utilita Arena. A bare-bones production, however, would not work for acts such as Dua Lipa, Bring Me the Horizon, Beyonc\u00e9 or Kendrick Lamar. Their shows at arenas and stadiums need to astound. But as shows scale up, so do associated costs. McAndrew explains that an arena show requires at least six articulated lorries to transport everything, as well as a crew of around 45 people \u2013 from roadies and riggers to tour managers and sound/lighting engineers \u2013 who all have to be bussed or flown between shows. \u201cThe actual profit won\u2019t be as significant as you might think because the costs are quite high,\u201d he says. Ticket prices are usually set by the promoter who takes the biggest risk, typically working on 20% of profits after venue hire and the act\u2019s guaranteed fee. The promoter will normally speak to the act and their agents about the proposed price to see if they feel it is not excessive for their fans or drastically out of step with the market. If they do not sell all the tickets, the act still gets their fee but the promoter absorbs the loss. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation between the agent and the artist as to what the ticket price should be,\u201d says Byrne. But what about the people selling the tickets? Laura Kramer, director and CEO of WeGotTickets, says ticketing companies may be the public-facing part of the business, but their cut of overall ticket sales is slim. WeGotTickets, for example, takes a maximum of 10%. It has to pay transaction charges on every ticket purchase and provide tools for event organisers, such as customer support and marketing, as well as handling refunds or rescheduled dates. \u201cOur revenue is our booking fee,\u201d says Kramer. \u201cWithout the booking fee, there is no independent ticket agent.\u201d While there have been legal changes in the UK whereby ticketing companies have to be fully transparent about precisely what extra costs \u2013 such as handling and transaction fees \u2013 are added to a ticket price, the business as a whole is not always transparent. There are shadowy shares of additional revenue split between ticket companies, acts and promoters. A megastar may negotiate part of the extra fees around tickets, classed as a rebate. A 2024 Which? study claimed such additional fees can add 25% to the price of tickets. There are also tales of acts securing a cut of venue bar takings and even the car parking. And then there is dynamic pricing, an issue that only affects acts getting blockbusting guarantees anyway. It has been justified by the live business as an attempt to neutralise price gouging on secondary sites. McAndrew feels dynamic pricing has a role in the industry, but that role must be conditional. \u201cIt has a place if it\u2019s limited and you\u2019re essentially serving a customer who is happy to pay a premium,\u201d such as corporate groups buying up VIP tickets for entertaining. Kramer, meanwhile, is fundamentally opposed to dynamic pricing. \u201cI don\u2019t think it belongs in live music at all,\u201d she asserts. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d Acts complaining about paltry payments from streaming, which followed on from the collapse of the more lucrative CD business, were instructed to play live more in order to make up for any shortfall in their income. But simply playing more shows is not a financial panacea \u2013 and there are only so many times they can play your local city or town before even the most loyal fans start to feel they are being squeezed. Ubiquity is the scourge of scarcity, the very thing live performance thrives on. Live\u2019s economics are proving to be as imbalanced as those of streaming. The top 1% make fortunes; everyone else is just getting by. In fact, argues Schroeder, \u201ctickets are underpriced generally. People don\u2019t understand the cost of touring to artists and how, in the vast majority of cases, people are losing money.\u201d Fans may feel concert tickets cost too much, but they often cost acts far more.",
