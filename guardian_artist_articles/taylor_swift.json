        "bodyText": "The Eras tour may have long wrapped its 20-month run \u2013 becoming the first tour to gross more than $2bn in the process \u2013 but by almost every measure, Taylor Swift remains the biggest pop star in the world: breaking records, uplifting local economies, and even bringing a new audience to American football thanks to her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce. Her monumental fanbase has never been bigger \u2013 so you\u2019ll doubtless have at least one Swiftie in your life. Swift\u2019s quippy lyrics and love of cats have seen her face (and cats\u2019 faces) plastered over all sorts of unofficial plasticky tat, but here\u2019s a more thoughtful way to buy Swift-inspired gifts, for people young and old. There\u2019s a blank space on the label: write their name! *** The best gifts for Taylor Swift fans *** Swiftie power Fangirls: Scenes From Modern Music Culture by Hannah Ewens \u00a313.64 at the Guardian Bookshop The Swifties are not only a rabid fanbase, they\u2019re considered a powerful force for advocacy. British critic Hannah Ewens\u2019s excellently reported book gets inside different fan cultures to examine their relationships to their chosen idol, their individual dynamics and their wider societal impact. *** Country trio Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing DVD \u00a31.22 at Amazon The Texan country trio, now known as the Chicks, are among Swift\u2019s biggest inspirations, inspiring her to sow clues in the lyrics sheets to her album and inadvertently teaching her the perils of talking about politics as a country act. This incredible 2006 documentary depicts the aftermath of singer Natalie Maines\u2019 criticism of George W Bush and the war in Iraq, including footage of former fans burning their CDs outside concerts. Track down a DVD or gift a stream. *** Cat lady Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats by TS Eliot \u00a39.99 at the Guardian Bookshop \u00a311.99 at Amazon Pulling double duty here, Old Possum is a gift for cat lovers, as Swift famously is \u2013 even playing into the \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d memes to make fun of US vice-president JD Vance\u2019s misogynist comments in the run-up to the 2024 election \u2013 and inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Cats. The less said about the 2019 film adaptation of the latter, the better but Swift\u2019s turn as Bombalurina, singing Macavity, a poem featured in this collection, was undoubtedly one of its few high points. *** Dance pioneer Fifteen Years of a Dancer\u2019s Life: With Some Account of Her Distinguished Friends by Lo\u00efe Fuller \u00a38.95 at Amazon \u00a315.38 at Abe Books While fans wait for Swift to release the re-recording of Reputation, there\u2019s time to learn about the life of the dancer and stage arts innovator who Swift thanked in the closing credits to the tour for that album, calling her a \u201cpioneer in the arts, dance and design \u2013 and who fought for artists to own their work\u201d. If you can\u2019t get enough of Fuller\u2019s life, follow this up with a collection of her scientific work, Lecture on Radium. *** The gift of film Mubi subscription From \u00a349.99 for three months at Mubi Swift has said that she became obsessed with cinematic history during the pandemic, fuelling her own directorial aspirations. Follow suit with a subscription to the UK\u2019s artsiest film archive. For more subscriptions to save you time and money, check out our guide *** Make-your-own friendship bracelet Woodland bracelet-making kit \u00a316.95 at Etsy \u00a317.95 at Not on the High Street The Swiftie friendship bracelet craze is cute, but the amount of plastic involved doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. Try a more eco-friendly option. *** The latest Sally Rooney Intermezzo \u00a318 at the Guardian Bookshop \u00a319 at Bookshop \u201cI think it\u2019s like being inside somebody\u2019s mind,\u201d Swift said of Rooney\u2019s first novel, Conversations With Friends. You can bet she\u2019s already read her new one, about two brothers coming to terms with grief. *** Every Taylor song explained Taylor Swift \u2013 The Stories Behind the Songs by Annie Zaleski \u00a322.50 at the Guardian Bookshop \u00a316.58 at Amazon From one of the US\u2019s sharpest and most compassionate music critics, this new book tells the story of the creation, lyrics and production behind every Swift song. It\u2019s a cut above the usual Swift cash-in publications. *** Mug up on Travis Kelce\u2019s sport Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream by H G Bissinger \u00a312.99 at the Guardian Bookshop \u00a312.34 at Bookshop Newly converted to American football by Swift\u2019s \u201cgigantic\u201d (Hugh Grant\u2019s words) boyfriend? Read Buzz Bissinger\u2019s classic account of a year in the life of a small-town Texas high school team (which inspired the 2000s TV show). *** Learn to play Swift\u2019s latest album Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology \u2013 Guitar Chords With Lyrics Songbook \u00a322 at Blackwell\u2019s \u00a338.50 (hardback) at Waterstones Swift has inspired thousands of young people to pick up a guitar. This official book on how to play every song on Tortured Poets \u2013 the extended version \u2013 is a great incentive to practise. *** Learn to write songs like Taylor How to Write One Song by Jeff Tweedy \u00a39.99 at the Guardian Bookshop \u00a39.49 at Bookshop For anyone making their first forays into songwriting, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco wrote this lovely, practical guide to completing a song. *** An album Taylor\u2019s ex loves Hats by The Blue Nile \u00a317.89 at Amazon On The Tortured Poets Department\u2019s Guilty as Sin?, Swift languishes in the memory of her tryst with the 1975\u2019s Matty Healy, easily identifiable as the devout fan of Scottish indie band The Blue Nile who, she sings, \u201csent me Downtown Lights\u201d. The classic 1989 album that gave us the song would make a very chic gift. *** The fashion brand Taylor loves Free People gift cards From \u00a310 at Free People Swift\u2019s style is much debated: does she often wear high street brands to remain accessible to fans, or is it just her taste? Either way, she wears a fair bit of Free People. *** Taylor\u2019s favourite red lippy? Retro Matte liquid lip colour \u00a325 at Mac \u00a325 at Asos Swift is a known Mac fan, and its Retro Matte range has the kind of staying power that three-hour live shows demand. *** Taylor\u2019s favourite Nigella recipe Feast: Food that Celebrates Life by Nigella Lawson \u00a330 at the Guardian Bookshop \u00a323.83 at Amazon When Swift wrote about 30 things she\u2019d learned before turning 30, she recommended having three staple dinner party recipes in your repertoire: from Feast, Nigella\u2019s Mughlai chicken is one of them. *** The support artist\u2019s LP Short n\u2019 Sweet LP by Sabrina Carpenter \u00a327.62 at Amazon \u00a334.99 at Rough Trade Last year\u2019s cheekiest breakout pop star supported on the US leg of the Eras tour. Her sixth album is a delight, spanning disco to country, adorned with lashings of innuendo. *** But Daddy, I Love Him inspo The Little Mermaid limited edition steelbook \u00a334.99 at HMV \u00a334.99 at Amazon A highlight of Tortured Poets, But Daddy, I Love Him!, takes its name from the scene in The Little Mermaid in which Ariel\u2019s father forbids her from pursuing her relationship with Prince Eric.

        "trailText": "Some say it\u2019s embarrassing. But as a \u2018Swiftie dad\u2019 attending the Eras tour, I felt the same rush as seeing Oasis in 1994, says author Sarfraz Manzoor",
        "bodyText": "This year, assuming I can get a ticket, I will be seeing Oasis on their reunion tour. I will be surrounded, I expect, by thousands of fellow middle-aged men lustily singing \u201cYou and I are gonna live forever\u201d \u2013 while knowing some of us won\u2019t even make it through the decade. Lately I have noticed that much of the music I listen to and the gigs I attend now have their roots in the past. I first saw Oasis when I was 23, and my greatest hope for this summer\u2019s concert is that it might briefly transport me back to the 1990s. I saw Pulp in 2023 and it was incredible \u2013 but mostly because it brought back memories of seeing the band decades ago. The same goes for Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan, who I saw last year. For my generation, gigs seem to function as temporary time machines that give you a chance to revisit the glory days. The only concert I attended last year that was not drenched in nostalgia was Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour. It was the most successful tour in history, and Swift is the biggest pop star on the planet, so it should not be entirely surprising that I had a total blast at the shows (yes, I went twice). But, according to some, I had no business even being there. A recent survey suggested that four in 10 of people between 25 and 34 think the idea of people in their 50s and 60s attending a Swift gig is embarrassing. It made me wonder how I would have felt, when I went to see Madonna in 1990 as a 19-year-old, if I had spotted anyone in their 50s in the audience. I suspect I would have thought they were quite cool. I have never cared about musical snobbery. When I was in my late teens I went to see Billy Joel on the River of Dreams tour while my friends were seeing the Stone Roses at Spike Island. (In 2013 I went to see Ian Brown at Finsbury Park in London to try to recall a youth I had never had.) In my early 20s I would go, inevitably alone, to see the likes of the Everly Brothers, Lou Reed and Tin Machine. I did so because I loved the music \u2013 or David Bowie in the case of Tin Machine \u2013 whether it was considered cool or embarrassing. That does not mean I cannot hazard a guess as to why some younger people may feel it is a little shameful to be in your 50s or 60s and enjoying music that is so obviously aimed at a much younger audience. In an age where music seems increasingly split down generational lines, crossing them can reek of the musical version of a midlife crisis. The vast majority of the audience at the Swift concert was young, female and sporting rather more glitter than me, but I did not feel at all uncomfortable because I was there to accompany my daughter, Laila \u2013 and anyone who might have glanced over to me would have firmly put me in the \u201cSwiftie dad\u201d box and carried on singing. If I had gone alone I would have been much more self-conscious. In effect, I am in a codependent relationship with my daughter \u2013 she needs a parent to go with her to concerts and I need a child. I am dreading the day she is old enough to go to them without me. When Laila was very young I influenced her musical tastes \u2013 which is why she wanted to see Springsteen and Paul McCartney with me \u2013 but now she is influencing mine. She introduced me to Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, as well as less well-known bands such as Sunday (1994). I could claim I only listen to these artists for the sake of a closer relationship with Laila, but the truth is that I really like their music. I feel grateful to have been introduced by my daughter to these artists because otherwise my musical diet would have remained largely unchanged since the 1990s \u2013 and be all the poorer for it. The first time I saw Oasis on stage was at the Ha\u00e7ienda in 1994. My abiding memory of that gig is feeling a rush of euphoria and joy. Swift\u2019s music may, to quote an artist from my generation, say nothing to me about my life, but it is smart and sophisticated, and watching her on stage I felt that same rush of euphoria and joy. It felt thrilling to be among young people happily creating their formative musical memories, and it felt liberating to be at a concert focused on the present, rather than looking back to a youth now half a world away.

        "headline": "End of an Eras era: what\u2019s next for Taylor Swift?",
        "trailText": "After a record-breaking $2bn global tour the mega-star is now looking to her next career step",
        "bodyText": "Few artists in the history of pop music have had a year like Taylor Swift. The singer, who turns 35 today, started off 2024 as the most prominent spectator at the Super Bowl, where Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs delivered on a romcom ending. Her blockbuster Eras Tour, showcasing 18-plus years of music over a staggering 3.5 hours, continued 2023\u2019s run as pop\u2019s main story overseas and became the best-selling music tour in history. Her 11th studio album, the Tortured Poets Department, may have been a misfire with critics (myself included), but still broke streaming records and dominated the charts; she was Spotify\u2019s most-streamed artist globally this year. The Eras Tour wrapped last weekend in Vancouver with more than $2bn in ticket sales from more than 10 million attendees \u2013 more than double the next all-time highest-grossing tour, in only 149 shows. In short, Swift is operating in exceedingly rare company, at a scale unimaginable to most artists. Her closest pop peer is arguably Beyonc\u00e9, whose only standard and point of comparison is herself. (Both also, notably, rarely grant interviews.) Which raises the question: after a remarkable run of both ubiquity and good press, after the genuinely mind-boggling and commerce-shifting success of the Eras Tour, what next? First and foremost, at least according to an \u201cexclusive\u201d source at People, is rest, and enjoying the holidays with her boyfriend/Eras tour staple Travis Kelce. And beyond that, a question of where to go when you\u2019re already at the top, especially as Swift\u2019s golden era was also a banner year for a new, younger wave of female artists raised on her music, including Chappell Roan and Eras Tour openers Sabrina Carpenter and Gracie Abrams. Before the all-consuming Eras Tour, Swift indicated a pivot toward film, having sold an original script to Searchlight Pictures in 2022, which she is also expected to direct. Details of the film have been kept tightly under wraps, other than it being an \u201cexciting and new creative journey\u201d, according to Searchlight heads David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield. Swift has previously directed or co-directed 13 music videos and All Too Well: The Short Film, a 15-minute extended music video treatment starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O\u2019Brien. The short film garnered some awards season recognition, with Swift expressing an interest in expanding her repertoire as a director. \u201cI think that I\u2019m at a place now where the next baby step is not a baby step. It would be committing to making a film,\u201d she said during a discussion at the 2022 Toronto Film Festival, in which she also said she wanted to tell \u201chuman stories about human emotion\u201d going to a \u201cmore comedic, irreverent place\u201d. Swift would follow a long line of pop stars who moved to film after success in the music business \u2013 particularly in their 30s. Lady Gaga was nominated for an Oscar in 2019 for A Star Is Born. Both Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande are in awards contention this year for their performances in Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked, respectively. Charli xcx, Swift\u2019s former tour opener (in 2018, for Reputation) whose mainstream takeover with Brat summer was arguably the pop story of the year, has publicly announced her intention to step back from music and focus on acting, with several roles on the calendar. (\u201cIt\u2019s a knife when you\u2019re finally on top, \u2019cause logically the next step is they want to see you fall to the bottom,\u201d she and Grande sing on the remix of Sympathy Is a Knife, a track originally thought to be about Swift that was redone following Brat\u2019s success; the industry is small and anxious.) It\u2019s too soon to tell whether Swift, who has always emphasized storytelling as the center of her career, will also seek to appear in front of the camera. Typically \u2013 as much as \u201ctypical\u201d exists in the rarefied world of pop \u2013 artists seeking a next step from music or the grind of touring move to residencies (think Adele\u2019s stay in Vegas), behind-the-scenes mentorship or extended hiatus. But Swift is famously productive \u2013 she has released five studio albums in as many years \u2013 so there\u2019s also the possibility of more new music. Swifties have made a cottage industry out of reading the \u201cclues\u201d for the fan-coveted re-recordings of Reputation and Swift\u2019s 2006 debut album, dates for which have yet to be announced. Swift has kept plans close to her chest, part of a longstanding effort to surprise fans. None of them would begrudge her time off. But she, by her own admission, loves to work. \u201cI\u2019m happier when I\u2019m making things more often,\u201d she told Martin McDonagh during a Directors on Directors chat two years ago. So while her next step is anyone\u2019s guess, best to bet on something.",

        "trailText": "Singer scores 13th chart-topper with Valentine\u2019s Day edition of her live album Lover (Live from Paris)",
        "bodyText": "Taylor Swift has broken Madonna\u2019s record as the female artist with the most No 1 albums in the UK, as her new live album Lover (Live From Paris) becomes her 13th chart-topper. It means she draws level with Elvis Presley as the international artist with the most No 1s. Still outpacing her are the Rolling Stones with 14, then Robbie Williams and the Beatles, joint top with 15. Featuring performances from the studio album of the same name, Lover (Live from Paris) is Swift\u2019s fourth live album, and the first to reach No 1. It was originally released in limited quantities for Valentine\u2019s Day in 2023, and reached No 90, but 47,000 sales of a new heart-shaped double vinyl version \u2013 the latest of the ever more elaborate and numerous physical editions of Swift albums \u2013 took it to the top. It\u2019s the biggest opening week for an album this year. Lover (Live from Paris) has never been released on streaming services as a whole album (though its tracks are individually available), and it\u2019s rare to get a No 1 album without streams. In fact, the last person to do it was Taylor Swift. Eight years ago she released Reputation, and got to No 1 solely from sales of the album, before putting it on streaming a few weeks later. It took Swift until her fourth album, 2012\u2019s Red, to score her first UK No 1, and her tally has since been helped by her project to rerecord her albums, with new versions of Fearless, Red, Speak Now and 1989 all topping the chart. Fans are now anticipating the last in this series, Reputation. Swift, however, may be enjoying some time off after her Eras tour, which became \u2013 by some distance \u2013 the highest-grossing concert tour of all time when it concluded in December. In at No 2 in this week\u2019s chart are rock band Inhaler, fronted by Bono\u2019s son Elijah Hewson, with their third album Open Wide. Kendrick Lamar jumps back into the Top 3 from No 31, buoyed up by the physical release of his album GNX and his much-discussed Super Bowl half-time show. The Super Bowl also propelled Lamar\u2019s Drake diss track Not Like Us up the singles chart to No 2, the highest placing for any Lamar track, though Lola Young\u2019s Messy remains at the top for a fourth week. The five Grammy awards won by Not Like Us will have helped its chart performance, and other Grammy winners have experienced a boost. Best new artist winner Chappell Roan\u2019s Pink Pony Club reaches a new high of No 4, while Benson Boone\u2019s former No 1 Beautiful Things vaults up to No 6 off the back of his acrobatic viral performance of the song at the awards. Doechii\u2019s Denial Is a River was another much-shared performance, and the track becomes her first Top 10 hit, at No 9.",

The pop star was in New Orleans to support her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, as his Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Eagles. When Swift was shown on the Superdome\u2019s videoscreens she was greeted with boos and appeared to mouth \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d In an appearance on the Howard Stern Show on Wednesday Barkley was asked about gossip around Kelce and Swift\u2019s possible engagement. Instead, he defended Swift. \u201cI remember that they showed her on the jumbotron, and she got booed. I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why she was getting hate there,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cShe was there supporting her significant other, and she\u2019s made the game bigger. In football we\u2019re all about, \u2018How can we expand the game and make it more [international]?\u2019 We\u2019re traveling to Brazil, we\u2019re traveling to Mexico. Apparently, we\u2019re traveling to Australia soon. We\u2019re trying to expand the game, and her being a part of it is only helping it. I don\u2019t get the dislike she\u2019s getting.\u201d Swift grew up near Philadelphia, has been photographed in Eagles gear and was assumed to be fan before she started appearing at Chiefs games in Kansas City jerseys when she started her relationship with Kelce. That may have led to Eagles fans booing her, although others speculated some in the crowd were reacting to her support for Kamala Harris in last year\u2019s presidential election. For his part, Barkley said he was delighted by the support he had received since joining the Eagles from their divisional rivals, the New York Giants, last year. \u201c[Eagles fans] just shower you with love,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been pretty cool for me and my family \u2018cause kind of how things ended in New York. There was always love and support there, but things didn\u2019t end off on a great note, I guess you could say. And to be able to come here and just the way how they\u2019ve taken me in and my family in, and my daughter is the star here. They love my little daughter. So it\u2019s been pretty cool.\u201d",

Subscriptions to streaming services such as Spotify, Amazon and Apple, and the revival in the popularity of vinyl, with sales increasing for 17 consecutive years, fuelled a 7.4% rise in music revenues to \u00a32.38bn last year, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA).

Revenues reached above the previous all-time high of \u00a32.2bn in 2001. \u201cMusic is back \u2013 thanks to streaming and the vinyl revival,\u201d said Kim Bayley, the chief executive of the ERA. \u201cFor decades it was new release activity which drove most revenues. Digital services and retailers have become the drivers of the market.\u201d Consumer spending on streaming subscriptions grew at 7.8% to top \u00a32bn for the first time last year. Spending on physical formats \u2013 CDs, vinyl and other formats such as cassettes \u2013 increased by 6.2% to \u00a3330m. Vinyl album sales outpaced the market at 10.5% to \u00a3196m, while CD album revenues remained flat at \u00a3126m. However, the figures are not adjusted for inflation, meaning total UK spending on music is still likely to be below the level recorded in 2001. The ERA said that total album sales hit 201.4m \u2013 a figure that includes physical sales and a conversion of streams into equivalent albums \u2013 led by Taylor Swift\u2019s The Tortured Poets Department at 783,820 units. The previous annual record for album sales was 172m set in 2004; however, this was based purely on physical sales. Last week, the industry body the British Phonographic Institute published figures on the volume of physical sales showing vinyl up 9% to 6.7m units. That report showed that CD sales declined by only 300,000 to 10.5m units and with a few hundred thousand sales of other formats, such as cassettes, total sales of physical recorded music showed an increase for the first time in two decades, to 17.4m. While spend on streaming accounts for about 85% of total UK music revenue, and 88% of the albums bought, the ERA does not expect the future to become digital-only. \u201cWe continue to believe that digital and physical channels are complementary and vital for the health of the entertainment market overall,\u201d Bayley said. The revival of the music industry through subscription services comes against the backdrop of continued complaints about remuneration for musicians and big-name acts seeking increased revenue from money-spinning tours. Tom Gray, the chair of the UK songwriters\u2019 body the Ivors Academy and a member of the band Gomez, said: \u201cA record-breaking year for whom? Music creators are not seeing a fair share of this success. \u201cWe urgently need to rethink how streaming revenues are distributed. The whole industry can see the potential harms of AI on the horizon and yet we haven\u2019t even got our own house in order.\u201d Naomi Pohl, the general secretary of the Musicians\u2019 Union, said: \u201cSadly, professional musicians, artists and songwriters are not enjoying the boom represented by these figures \u2026 \u201cThey are facing multiple problems including the high cost of living and touring, stagnating public arts funding, problems touring in the EU post-Brexit and, crucially, they are not receiving their fair share of streaming revenue.\u201d The ERA report also looks at the performance of the digital video market, which is led by Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, and the gaming market. Spending on subscription digital video services, the largest of the three sectors surveyed, increased at 6.9% to hit \u00a35bn for the first time. Subscriptions to services such as Netflix increased by 8.3% to \u00a34.46bn, accounting for almost 90% of the sector\u2019s revenues. Revenues for physical sales of DVDs and Blu-ray Discs continued to decline, falling 7.9% to \u00a3156m. The most popular title bought or rented by consumers was Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, with sales of 561,917. More than 80% of the purchases were through a digital channel. The games market, which was eclipsed in value by the video sector for the first time last year, declined by 4.4% to \u00a34.6bn. The biggest-selling game of the year once again proved to be the latest edition of EA Sports FC, formerly known as Fifa Sports, which generated 2.9m unit sales, 80% of them digital. \u201cAfter the breakneck growth of recent years it is no surprise that the games market has slowed down,\u201d Bayley said. \u201cBut it remains a giant, nearly twice as large as the recorded music business.\u201d",

        "headline": "Kendrick Lamar to hit Super Bowl stage as Taylor Swift and Trump set to attend",
        "trailText": "Grammy-winning rapper will bring controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us to US\u2019s biggest TV audience of the year",
        "bodyText": "Kendrick Lamar is preparing to go from Grammys glory to the Super Bowl half-time show as the biggest US sporting event of the year arrives in New Orleans this weekend. The acclaimed rapper won five Grammy awards last weekend for his controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us. The song is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit with lyrics calling the Canadian star a \u201ccertified paedophile\u201d. Drake\u2019s lawyers have called the song \u201cdangerous\u201d in a filing made last month. According to TMZ, Lamar will definitely be including the song in his performance but the question remains as to which lyrics will be deemed suitable for the telecast by both the NFL and Fox, who will be airing the game. Lamar is no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having appeared during 2022\u2019s hip-hop and R&amp;B headliner show alongside Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J Blige. In an interview this week, he spoke of the importance of bringing his \u201cLA energy\u201d with him on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s something I wanted to carry over to New Orleans and for the world to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is me. This is Kendrick Lamar, 37 years old, and I still feel like I\u2019m elevating, I\u2019m still on a journey.\u201d When asked about what viewers can expect, he said that \u201cstorytelling\u201d will be a key component of his set. Speculation has been rife over who his surprise guests will be, with only SZA as yet confirmed. The pair recently announced a major arena tour starting later this year. \u201cWhat I can say is he\u2019s worked really hard on it,\u201d SZA said at the Grammys. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so honored to be a part of it and I\u2019m so honored to even know him and exist in the same time as someone as brilliant as him.\u201d Taylor Swift is set to attend again in support of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, whose team, the Kansas City Chiefs, will face the Philadelphia Eagles. Swift, who previously collaborated with Lamar on the single Bad Blood, will reportedly watch the game from a $2m suite at the Caesars Superdome with rumours of celebrity friends alongside. Last year she brought Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, Ice Spice, Lana Del Rey and Ryan Reynolds with her. The singer will face her own competition within the stadium with Donald Trump set to attend, the first time a sitting president has watched the game in person. After Swift showed her support for the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, last year, Trump posted online: \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\u201d In a 2019 interview with the Guardian, Swift said: \u201cWe\u2019re a democracy \u2013 at least, we\u2019re supposed to be \u2013 where you\u2019re allowed to disagree, dissent, debate. I really think that he thinks this is an autocracy.\u201d When Kelce was asked about Trump\u2019s attendance this week he said: \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s a great honor. I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I\u2019m excited because it\u2019s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there \u2013 it\u2019s the best country in the world \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d The cost of a Super Bowl ad has also risen this year to $8m for a 30-second spot. Major commercials this year will include stars such as Ben Affleck, Charli xcx, Matthew McConaughey, Glen Powell, Greta Gerwig and a reunion for the When Harry Met Sally stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal. The Hollywood Reporter is claiming through sources that many big stars are receiving $3-5m for leading ads. One of the most controversial spots on Sunday may come from the divisive artificial intelligence company OpenAI. It will mark the first foray into commercial advertising for the firm behind ChatGPT. Google has already been forced to edit an ad for its AI tool after it included a false statistic about global gouda consumption, a mistake that was blamed on AI itself. Last year\u2019s Super Bowl attracted about 123 million viewers.",

        "headline": "Super Bowl: Kendrick Lamar, the ads, Taylor Swift and everything but the football \u2013 as it happened",
        "trailText": "While the game goes ahead, it\u2019s a big night for culture with a much-anticipated half-time show, a string of big name ads and a returning role for Taylor Swift",
        "bodyText": "So Taylor\u2019s boyfriend didn\u2019t win this year, that much we know (Taylor, on the receiving end of some pretty juvenile boos, didn\u2019t seem to have the greatest of nights this time around) but he wasn\u2019t the night\u2019s biggest loser \u2013 that would be Drake. The Canadian rapper has been on the receiving end of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s ridicule for months now, and tonight we got to see the perfect finale, the Grammy-winning diss track Not Like Us performed for America\u2019s biggest TV audience of the year. It was the most obvious crowd-pleasing moment of a mostly unconventional set, avoiding bigger songs and relying on social commentary, via Samuel L Jackson, that challenged an audience accustomed to an easy ride. The ads of the night were starrier than usual, as was the stadium itself, but there was also an unpleasant amount of both AI spots and those that were not exactly political but were patriotic in an old-fashioned way that felt prioritised at the expense of anything more progressive (No gays! No trans! Just one mention of climate change!). It tracked that it was the year that Trump turned up. At least he got to see Kendrick Lamar perform. F1 The big Super Bowl spot for Brad Pitt\u2019s F1, one of the summer\u2019s biggest question marks, continues the good work done by last year\u2019s first trailer, focusing on multi-sense immersion. It\u2019s set to be the most authentic racing film we\u2019ve ever seen, made in collaboration with the governing body behind Formula One and filmed during actual events over the last couple of years, and the stripped-back new ad highlights such authenticity. Hopes are high with a giant budget and backers Apple still waiting for their first genuine box office hit but if anyone can make this kind of unlikely magic happen, it\u2019s Joseph Kosinski, who also steered Top Gun: Maverick from curio to blockbuster. Smurfs In year that\u2019s lazily bringing back more franchises than ever before from Jurassic World to Final Destination to 28 Days Later to How to Train Your Dragon, why not try once again to make Smurfs work? The characters have moved from Sony to Paramount after two connected films and one reboot and all bets have now been placed on Rihanna as Smurfette, following in the footsteps of Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. After all that wait, is the new Rihanna album going to be a Smurfs soundtrack? The next chapter in the story of soda A wildly ambitious ad here from Poppi, that slightly more expensive and substantially less tasty alternative to regular soda. According to the voiceover, Poppi is what what your kids will think of when they think of soda! Poppi is the next chapter in the story of soda! It\u2019s enough to scare one into actually drinking Poppi. Super Bowl ads always lean patriotic \u2013 Budweiser Clydesdales, etc \u2013 but this year had an especially awkward edge. The current political divide is stark, and the president who is currently attempting to dismantle much of the government was in attendance tonight. And yet many of the ads and game promos, starring A-list celebrities such as Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, blithely championed American iconography: freedom, flags, the open range and, of course, football. That\u2019s the job, but especially absent any topics considered \u201cwoke\u201d (Kendrick\u2019s half-time show notwithstanding), the disconnect was striking. Carl\u2019s Jr brings back bikinis Eight years after ditching the strategy of using models in bikinis to sell their burgers, Carl\u2019s Jr returns with TikTok influencer Alix Earle doing just that. Well, tonight was not the romcom sequel for Taylor Swift. You do not need to understand football to know that Travis Kelce\u2019s team didn\u2019t play well. No shots of Taylor cheering during a pivotal moment. The Chiefs, and TNT, were never underdogs, but didn\u2019t even have the semblance of being underdogs this year, and popular sentiment was solidly in favor of the other team. Taylor even got some boos when she appeared on the jumbotron: She did get some support from Serena Williams, though. And she will be fine, of course. Andy Reid\u2019s side hustle Andy Reid, leader of the Kansas City Chiefs, is making a play to fill the void of America\u2019s favorite NFL coach left by \u2026 no one \u2026 with this riff on the side hustle. First it was Zoolander-esque hand-modeling \u2013 the better to show off what three Super Bowl rings you have \u2013 and now it is Skechers no hands slide-ons. Here\u2019s Sam Wolfson\u2019s great four-star review of tonight\u2019s half-time show: Novocaine As audiences prefer to stick with known quantities like Keanu Reeves, Gerard Butler and Jason Statham, Hollywood continues to try out new action stars with mostly middling results. Aaron Taylor-Johnson couldn\u2019t get anyone craving some Kraven the Hunter, Henry Cavill scored two flops back-to-back with Argylle and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, and this weekend, Ke Huy Quan\u2019s first leading vehicle Love Hurts went nowhere for nobody all at once (it opened to a pitiful $5.8m). Will they warm to Ana de Armas in John Wick summer spinoff Ballerina or maybe Jack Quaid, best known for Amazon\u2019s The Boys and last month\u2019s Companion, in gimmicky caper Novocaine? He plays a man incapable of feeling pain whose girlfriend is kidnapped. Given the pricey placement of this new tease, it\u2019s clear that Paramount is hoping for big things from a film that looks like it has a very small budget. All said and done, Kendrick\u2019s \u201cHey Drake\u201d impish grin is definitely the meme of the night. Some highlights from what remains of the site formerly known as Twitter: Cher turns back time for Uber Eats Uber would like you to know that they too know the memes on Cher not aging \u2013 in another budget-flex ad clearly inspired by one of the greatest ever Twitter (never X) threads, Cher uses her powers of timelessness/Uber Eats to turn back time \u2026 to the era of witch trials. Walton Goggins\u2019s AI goggle glasses Walton Goggins is the latest celebrity to hop on the AI endorsement train, for GoDaddy\u2019s Airo, a generative AI service for small businesses. Lol that the ad compares AI\u2019s ability to produce things you don\u2019t know how to make \u2013 like a logo for Walton Goggins\u2019s goggle glasses \u2013 to the skills of \u2026 a human actor. I think you should eat The internet\u2019s favorite IYKYK comedians Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson bring their signature absurd comedy of manners to this Totino\u2019s Pizza Rolls spot that is basically an IYKYK ad for Robinson\u2019s Netflix series I Think You Should Leave. I am personally delighted to see what deranged platitudes they can deliver in under 10 seconds. There\u2019s also some footage of the guy who was tackled and removed during the performance after he rushed onto the field with a Palestine flag: Here\u2019s the full half-time performance if you missed it: Muppets on vacation No one has quite figured out what to do with the Muppets ever since they returned in 2010\u2019s rather wonderful movie. There was a middling sequel, a one-season ABC series and a one-season Disney+ series, the characters currently stuck in Disney\u2019a vault until someone else reboots them. They\u2019ve been let out for a brief appearance in this Booking.com ad, their umpteenth Super Bowl ad that, as has become standard, doesn\u2019t really know what to do with them. Dove goes for body positivity In a spot aiming for serious and sentimental, Dove makes another case for changing the way we talk to girls about their bodies, comparing the joy a three-year-old finds in running to the self-hatred a 14-year-old feels about her legs. No product, just a call to treat girls better, becauseone in two who quit sports are criticized for their bodies. Oof. David Beckham\u2019s long-lost brother? In an ad clearly going for the \u201cmost cinematic\u201d award of the night, David Beckham learns he has a long-lost brother, whom his parents named \u201cOther David\u201d. Enter Matt Damon, playing Other David, and the pair bond over a pint, \u201csoccer\u201d (meaning \u201cfootball\u201d) and requisite Ben Affleck ribbing. In surround sound: Harrison Ford waxes poetic for Jeep Wow, Harrison Ford is really feeling his Yellowstone era (he stars in 1923). The actor appears, mug in hand, in a lodge by the mountains, in stoic main character mode for a video essay on the importance of writing your own story, life\u2019s owner\u2019s manuals and freedom, etc. Some shots of American soldiers and the beautiful Rockies gives an extra layer of weird patriotism to this rambling Jeep ad, one of several weirdly patriotic spots tonight. A serious note for climate change A break from things to buy with a spot on something more pressing: climate change. The ad, from a group from Science Moms and the Potential Energy Coalition, is blunt on the point that we\u2019re running out of time to make necessary changes for the climate, and to give our children the world we promised. The ad apparently only aired in LA and on streaming, but will still presumably reach millions, along with all that AI promo. Is there any celebrity who isn\u2019t there tonight? Apart from Drake ofc: One of the best SNL Super Bowl skits imagined a world where the half-time guest cancelled at the last minute and was replaced by Broadway musical theatre actors. Cue horror: Stop enjoying those mozzarella sticks It\u2019s time to back away from the snacks thanks to a rollercoaster ad here from telehealth company Hims and Hers. First we\u2019re scared \u2013 obesity is a deadly epidemic that kills millions - then we\u2019re angry \u2013 there\u2019s a $160bn industry that profits from urging us to lose weight \u2013 then we\u2019re relieved \u2013 the answer lies with, you got this, Hims and Hers and a range of effective but, wait, still not exactly free medications. Now we\u2019re hungry again. Still hung up on Not Like Us over here, the second of two Drake diss tracks (the other being Euphoria) that Kendrick performed to the largest audience of his career. Interestingly, Kendrick made some adjustments to the lyrics for the broadcast \u2013 he notably skipped over the word \u201cpedophile\u201d (the center of Drake\u2019s defamation lawsuit against UMG), but did get the whole crowd in for \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d. And, well, he said this. Not a good night for Drake: The Bud Light boys are back Bud Light smartly recruited the two most Bud Light-y of celebrities \u2013 longtime rep Post \u201cSolo cup on stage\u201d Malone and comedian Shane \u201chold my beer\u201d Gillis \u2013 for this year\u2019s spot, fittingly set in an archetypical suburban cul-de-sac. The message? Bud Light lets dudes be dudes. Somehow this successfully toes the line between \u201cAmerica, fuck yeah!\u201d and \u201cactually could be fun\u201d. H\u00e4agen-Dazs slows it down Fast and Furious fam Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris slow down thanks to the smooth jams of Smokey Robinson and an ice-cream bar. There are shades of a 2000s-era Viagra commercial thanks to the mood music, Pacific Coast Highway locale and vintage car. Kieran Culkin is baby beluga Kieran Culkin, the former Succession star on the awards circuit this year for playing a very Kieran Culkin character, appears here as a very Kieran Culkin character who is also a financially savvy beluga whale. I think this counts as part of the Oscar campaign? Go away, Doja Cat In a year that\u2019s more stuffed with celebrity ads than usual, a rather funny use here of a rather funny Doja Cat forcing her way into Taco Bell\u2019s celebrity-free Super Bowl ad. Get her on SNL! Jurassic World: Rebirth While the Jurassic World movies might have failed to reach the lofty heights of Jurassic Park, I\u2019d argue they were mostly more successful than the two films that followed it. That, some hard-to-shake nostalgia and the pairing of Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali make it difficult not to get just a bit excited about the still completely unnecessary Jurassic World: Rebirth. The new spot is essentially a remix of the recent trailer but then that was a remix of everything that came before anyway. It appears that someone briefly crashed Kendrick\u2019s performance with a Palestinian flag with the words Sudan and Gaza written on it, even getting on the set\u2019s GNX car. According to Guardian sports editor Bryan Graham, who is at the game, the person waved the flag for about 45 seconds before security guards tackled them. Tipsy on sugar Shaboozey might not have won any Grammy awards for his monster hit Tipsy but he did get the chance to sing It\u2019s a Wonderful World in a Super Bowl ad for Nerds gummy clusters, so every cloud \u2026 Kendrick really will not give Drake a break, even taking a fresh swipe at him during the show. \u201cI want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,\u201d he said during one tease of Not Like Us, referring to Drake\u2019s defamation lawsuit over the track. Even abridged and censored, the song was still an astonishing W for the rap beef. Even rumored former Drake paramour Serena Williams was on stage for the occasion. Naturally, it also lit up the internet. Nate Bargatze balls out for DoorDash Nate Bargatze is on a roll \u2013 after hosting Saturday Night Live for the second time this fall, and thus being one of the more famous standup comics in America, he\u2019s now applying his dry humor to a Super Bowl ad in support of DoorDash\u2019s rewards program. My main question is: where did he get this Met Gala-worthy robe? Matthew McConaughey vouches for good AI Another commercial break, another celebrity vouching for some version of AI \u2013 in this case, Matthew McConaughey gets stranded in the rain because his booking app doesn\u2019t use Salesforce\u2019s AI assistant Agentforce, while Woody Harrelson has a nice dry meal. An attempt to assuage fears with folksiness, as McConaughey assures it\u2019s \u201cwhat AI was meant to be\u201d. Also if Samuel L Jackson turning up wasn\u2019t enough of a surprise\u2026 And here are some closer looks at Kendrick\u2019s show-stopping performance (with guests): Was it just me, or did that show feel like it flew by? Kendrick ends on a high note with a shoutout to Compton and his collaborator, Mustard, for the GNX track tv off. Kendrick and was confident and in command throughout, SZA sounded amazing, the act was a political statement in its existence \u2013 a solid Super Bowl half-time show. Here\u2019s that moment: Oh, he\u2019s really teasing and dragging out the intro to Not Like Us, this must feel good. \u201cThey tried to rig the game but you can\u2019t fake influence,\u201d he says before launching into the hit of last year. Well, it happened. We heard \u201chey Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young\u201d at the Super Bowl, along with tens of thousands trilling \u201cA minorrrrrr\u201d. Kendrick is bouncing between the eras \u2013 Damn, GNX (he teases Not Like Us, but not yet!), then slows it down with SZA for Luther and their Black Panther hit All the Stars. All smooth and mesmerizing so far. Oh hell yeah, Jackson once again appears to mock so many criticisms of rap music \u2013 \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto\u201d \u2013 before Kendrick goes into Humble, with his red, white and blue dancers forming an American flag of Black faces. That\u2019s quite an image. Alright, alright, Kendrick is here. Samuel \u201cUncle Sam\u201d Jackson introduces the one and only Kendrick, who starts a cappella on a GNX before he brings out a team of coordinated dancers and a statement \u2013 \u201cThe revolution about to be televised, you picked the right time but the wrong guy\u201d \u2013 before launching into Squabble UP. Let\u2019s goooooo. OK, we\u2019re minutes away from Kendrick\u2019s half-time show, and we can see behind the commentators that a GNX is now at midfield, the platform is being wiped down, the smoke is billowing, the lights are going down \u2026 almost go time! If there\u2019s any remaining doubt about whether Kendrick\u2019s going to perform Not Like Us in a few minutes: they cranked it up for the crowd while the stage crew set up for his show \u2026 With the statement released, Drake is as far away as possible (Australia) wearing \u2026 this (swipe for the boots): Drake has spoken! Ahead of Kendrick\u2019s half-time performance, in which he will almost certainly sing his Drake diss track to a 100-plus million people, the Canadian rapper released a statement doubling down on his claim of defamation: For reference, Drake has sued his and Kendrick\u2019s label, Universal Music Group \u2013 not Kendrick himself \u2013 accusing the company or prioritizing profits, for a hit song calling him a pedophile, over the truth/his mental health. Welcome to Magic Mike\u2019s Wrexham St\u014dk Cold Brew\u2019s first Super Bowl ad (is this the go-to grocery store coffee now?), invokes the power of franchise brands: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s Wrexham football club and, more entertainingly, Magic Mike. Good to know Channing Tatum\u2019s still game and still got it. Nike convenes the female all-stars This one\u2019s for the girls! Nike recruits a stacked roster \u2013 Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Caitlin Clark and Jordan Chiles, among others \u2013 for a spot roasting all the criticisms people will lob at female athletes. Such as: you can\u2019t be too ambitious, fill a stadium, be too emotional, etc. Some sick shots of Chiles doing gymnastics. Co-signing and cc-ing Hellmann\u2019s: Glen Powell\u2019s pickup truck fairytale Glen Powell, a proud Texan and one of Hollywood\u2019s It boys, appeals to his base: women and men who love trucks (especially the Dodge Ram). Powell is so game for anything that this revisionist fairytale of a man and his three bear-ish trucks is actually pretty charming. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s gig as the half-time show performer arrives at an unprecedentedly great time for the Compton-bred rapper, and a very bad time for Drake. The two stars\u2019 rap beef last year lit up the charts and the culture; last week, Kendrick stomped the nail in the coffin by winning not one but five Grammys for his diss track Not Like Us, a masterpiece of studied hater energy. I will not soon forget the image of Kendrick accepting his song of the year award as the crowd trilled \u201cA minorrrrrr\u201d. It only gets worse for Drake, because it\u2019s likely a stadium full of people will sing that line tonight. There\u2019s almost no way Kendrick, who guested during Dr Dre\u2019s half-time hip-hop bonanza three years ago, will leave the summer smash off the setlist. As for what else to expect \u2026 Collaborator SZA is confirmed to make an appearance. And in a rare interview with Apple Music, Kendrick promised \u201cstorytelling\u201d \u2013 be that on Drake or, more likely, in support of Compton and Black America, we shall have to wait and see. A horse walks into a bar Super Bowl regulars Budweiser here to teach us that every young horse\u2019s childhood dream is to help people drink cheap watery beer. Inspiring! Pringles makes moustaches fly Another ad with flying facial hair? The always welcome Adam Brody sounds the empty Pringles can alarm, accidentally transforming many a famous moustache (Nick Offerman, Andy Reid) into a disconcerting facial hair moth-like thing. When Harry Met Hellman\u2019s A \u201chow have they not done this yet?\u201d moment from Hellman\u2019s, in which Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal revive the famous Katz\u2019s deli scene from When Harry Met Sally. Sydney Sweeney steps in for the role of the \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having\u201d granny. So that reported Open AI ad for ChatGPT has aired \u2013 a simple black and white design in pointillist dots, because \u201call progress has a starting point\u201d. It frames ChatGPT as a tool for human expression, asking \u201cwhat do you want to create next?\u201d Which is \u2026 an interesting framing. Poor Kendrick getting drenched in Gatorade here by one of tonight\u2019s special guests, SZA. Impressive calm: Nestle gets tongues dancing Nestle\u2019s first-time Super Bowl spot for Coffee Mate is a now rare thing: an ad without a celebrity. At least, a visible one \u2013 an off-screen Shania Twain gets saddled with a jingle about a tongue left dancing from allegedly delicious cold foam. Cooking for aliens One of the laziest pick-up-the-cheque-and-run celebrity ads of the night has Gordon Ramsay being told he needs to cook for some foodie aliens before discovering that a) their hi-tech frying pans are in fact HexClad, a brand he already uses, and b) their leader is Pete Davidson. Worse than it sounds! It\u2019s a big day for SZA fans \u2013 earlier today, ahead of her appearance during Kendrick Lamar\u2019s half-time show, she released four new songs off Lana, the deluxe edition of her Grammy-winning album SOS. The new tracks \u2013 Joni (featuring Don Toliver), Take You Down, Open Arms (just SZA) and PSA \u2013 are basically updated version of songs that have been floating around for awhile, but still, a win for SZA fans. As a football game, the Super Bowl has stayed pretty consistent in recent years \u2013 the Chiefs versus someone. As a spectacle of American capitalism, it has ballooned. The price of a 30-second spot this year \u2013 let alone the celebrities featured in them \u2013 surpassed $8m, a new record for America\u2019s most-watched game. Pre-game ads are also busting the bank, going for a reported $4m or so. That\u2019s not the inevitable growth of inflation; just six years ago, the spots were becoming difficult to sell, the attention not seen as entirely worth the price. But the rise of diffuse streaming platforms means the rare opportunity for millions upon millions of eyeballs looking at the same thing at once \u2013 and advertisers are paying for it. Google\u2019s AI goes for the heart The night\u2019s requisite tearjerker, about a man using Google\u2019s Gemini AI voicebot to help him prep for a job interview after years off the market as a stay-at-home dad. One of the lasting images from last week\u2019s Grammys: a prolific hater salutes a fellow prolific hater, as his diss track wins song of the year. The Super Bowl is an almost assured victory lap for infamous grudge holders Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, regardless of the outcome of the game. Issa Rae does her taxes Issa Rae drives backwards down a highway to correctly point out that taxes suck and are unnecessarily confusing \u2013 the solution being TurboTax. She also gets to play \u201cis it cake?\u201d with a box of forms. Celebs celebing together: Uber Eats orders all the celebs Last year, Uber Eats reunited Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer for a Ross and Rachel-themed spot, this time it flexes that celebrity budget again with Matthew McConaughey as a conspiracy theorist who believes that football was invented to sell people food \u2013 with cameos from Kevin Bacon, Charli xcx, Martha Stewart and Greta Gerwig. Only for salty freaks Who new Ritz had such game? The saltiest cracker brand has hired the saltiest of celebrities \u2013 Aubrey Plaza and Michael Shannon \u2013 for their new Super Bowl spot, trying to outdo each other, only to be met with a very smiley Bad Bunny, breaking the rules. One of tonight\u2019s better ideas and smarter use of celebrities. Like presumably half the viewers this evening, we have eyes on Taylor Swift, who is in her private zone with Ice Spice, the Haim sisters and her family: Wearing bedazzled (lol) jean shorts with white leather boots: Making meme-ories already: And a full look at TNT\u2019s fits \u2013 she is at least true to her style with the thigh-high boots, oversized jacket and cut-off denim. Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg say no to hate Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg list reasons people hate \u2013 because you\u2019re from a different neighborhood, look different, act different, are different \u2013 in this spot that calls for people to \u201cstand up to hate\u201d. A nice message, to be sure, though quite hypocritical given that it\u2019s on behalf of the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism \u2013 a group founded by Patriots owner and noted Zionist Robert Kraft, who has blamed protests against Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza, which has killed an estimated 60,000 people, on \u201cdisinformation\u201d and conflated Palestine with Hamas. Coors has a bad case of the Mondays An ad that might make you rethink that last beer from Coors, about sloths at work the day after the Super Bowl, perhaps one of the Monday-ist Mondays of the year. Food Avengers assemble A pretty smart ad here from app Instacart that turns a standard shopping list into a range of characters storming their way to your day. There\u2019s the Jolly Green Giant, the Kool-Aid Man and even a cameo from the shirtless Old Spice guy Isaiah Mustafa, making us all feel guilty for how much of that dip we\u2019ve already eaten. Tripping on Baja Blast Here\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from this Mountain Dew ad: drink enough Baja Blast and you\u2019ll trip so hard you imagine Seal (the singer) as a seal (the marine mammal) crooning the 1995 hit and dentist office standard Kiss from a Rose \u2013 er, lime, in this case. Barry Keoghan\u2019s donkey gets a website In a cute and clever spot that capitalizes on both Irish accents and latent goodwill for all Irish donkeys, Squarespace reunites the two breakout stars of 2022\u2019s The Banshees of Inisherin: Barry Keoghan and Jenny the Donkey (justice for Jenny!). Except Jenny is actually Don Mosley the donkey, seeking a publicist and agent via his new website. A lot of futurist ads and American propaganda already this evening. And fittingly, T-Mobile has backed away from celebrities for a primetime spot touting its partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, which promises to bring satellite connections to all of the cellular dead zones in the US. Likely won\u2019t be the only ad helping out a tech billionaire this evening! Michelob\u2019s Ultra pickleball players My favorite spot of the night so far, because there is no better pair of actors to play to deceptively serious, deviously talented pickleball players than Catherina O\u2019Hara and Willem Dafoe. A delight from start to trophy finish. Thunderbolts Disney also teased its other big summer bet Thunderbolts with a 30-second version of a brand new trailer that\u2019s just been released online. \u201cThe Avengers are not coming\u201d says Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s Wario-ed Nick Fury at the start of the preview for the sorta antiheroes assemble caper (technically not true given that a new Avengers film has been given the green light) before a series of quips, explosions and an ironically used 80s pop song are trotted out to hopefully lure Deadpool fans to their local cinema this May. Meta tries distraction How should Meta distract users from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s cozy embrace of Trump, nixing of DEI programs and factchecking services on the platform, and very weird comments about masculinity? How about a Super Bowl ad for Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses, featuring Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt perusing (and destroying) Kris Jenner\u2019s art collection? Barrymore and Bloom make small talk Drew Barrymore and Orlando Bloom come together, and compare accents (how to say schedule, etc), for MSC Cruises How to Train Your Dragon Maybe one of the least necessary animated-to-live-action transfers we\u2019ve been lumped with for a while, the How to Train Your Dragon spot doesn\u2019t offer anything we didn\u2019t already expect and haven\u2019t already seen before. It feels like the original wasn\u2019t all that long ago and with the dragon looking essentially the same in both, it\u2019s a struggle to know why we\u2019re here again. Eugene Levy loses his eyebrows Little Caesars\u2019s Crazy Puffs are so eyebrow-raising delectable that they cause Eugene Levy\u2019s famously strong brows to fly right off his face like a gray, distinguished moth \u2013 which makes for images more unnerving than appealing. Lilo and Stitch Disney deserves some reluctant credit here for creating a Super Bowl ad that doesn\u2019t just resemble a condensed trailer, turning something eye-rollingly predictable (a live-action Lilo &amp; Stitch) into an advert we're actually surprised by. The 30-second spot has the once-animated, now CG monster invade the pitch, helping to kick off a campaign that will most likely make the most of all Fox and Disney channels in the next few months. Ben Affleck doubles down for Dunkin\u2019 Aaaand the first commercial of the game goes to Ben Affleck, who would like you to forget that last year he did his Dunkin\u2019 spot with one Jennifer Lopez \u2026 but not that he\u2019s forever and always from Boston. This first clip is actually part of a seven-minute short film called DunKings 2, featuring his brother Casey, former Patriots coach Bill Belichick, Belichick\u2019s 24-year-old girlfriend and Jeremy Strong, poking fun at his Serious Actor reputation. And here\u2019s that aforementioned Lady Gaga performance: Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning There are many many restarts this summer \u2013 Final Destination, Fantastic Four, Jurassic World \u2013 but there is one major end. Just don\u2019t tell Tom Cruise. What is now being marketed as the last Mission: Impossible film was once supposed to be the second part of the seventh yet underwhelming box office has changed both title and strategy with Paramount hoping, reportedly against its star\u2019s wishes, to wrap things up. This new spot pushes that selling point hard, a sad goodbye for one of the only consistently enjoyable franchises we have. She did say So High School \u2026 And one final performance from another noted New Orleans performer \u2013 Jon Batiste delivers a spirited and upbeat national anthem with a little jazz flavor, accompanied by a beautifully painted piano and, naturally (because America), fighter jets. Still rolling through the music performances prior to kickoff \u2013 Trombone Shorty and contemporary Christian singer Lauren Daigle, both natives of Louisiana, perform a jazzy version of America the Beautiful. Much more successful than Fergie\u2019s infamously jazzy national anthem. An especially star-studded Super Bowl this year! Missouri native Jon Hamm introduces the Kansas City Chiefs and noted Philly fan Bradley Cooper brings in his hometown Philadelphia Eagles. And that\u2019s it from us on the teams in this game! More celebs! In fact, more celebs than usual at the Super Bowl? Here\u2019s that very patriotic Brad Pitt ad: Now we\u2019re on to a musical celebration of New Orleans, from jazz to hip-hop, marching big brass bands to bounce, featuring Harry Connick, Jr (and the voice of New Orleans cultural icon Big Freedia). A hype way to start the evening, and convincing that New Orleans is a premiere US city for live music. On a pure name recognition level, the two most famous people in attendance tonight are Taylor Swift and Donald Trump. One very much wants to be associated with the other, and one would love to have her name out of his mouth. A brief rundown of their terse relations: Trump, you may recall, published an AI-generated fake endorsement from Swift last summer. The singer \u2013 who avoided politics entirely until 2018 and remains loath to make a statement \u2013 then supported Kamala Harris with a very Taylor Instagram post calling out said fake endorsement. Trump then posted on Truth Social: \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.\u201d So I would not expect them to interact tonight, nor would I want to see it. A pre-recorded video paying tribute to the resilience and community of New Orleans in the face of the recent tragic truck attack in January. Lady Gaga, all in white, is performing an emotional performance of her Top Gun: Maverick theme to a crowd of locals and some football celebrities. It\u2019s a smart way to nod to recent events and provide a rousing kickoff to tonight\u2019s events. Video to come soon \u2026 Brad Pitt is making sure you know that football is culture. The actor just showed up in a PSA for \u2026 the Super Bowl? That was essentially a rambling collage of American propaganda. Appearing in New Orleans \u2013 an interesting choice, given the many issues with homes his foundation built there post-Katrina \u2013 Pitt waxes poetic on the football huddle as \u201ca metaphor for our history\u201d along with many platitudes on American unity, for a game Donald Trump is attending. Planes, trains and Oikos A planes, trains and automobiles theme from Dannon\u2019s Oikos Greek yoghurt: Juno Temple carries Cleveland Browns defensive end Miles Garrett on her back through a busy terminal so he can catch his plane on time. Remember when Super Bowl advertisers tried very hard to convince people to buy into crypto? (Tom Brady would love you to forget.) Or the year with weird Scientology ads? This year, the mainstream normalization push is for AI. Several companies, including Google, Meta and Salesforce, will have spots touting their AI ventures. And OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, will purportedly have their first Big Game ad, assumedly to make generative AI seem less scary to the average American consumer. We just had a pretty stirring performance from Ledisi of Lift Every Voice and Sing. Given the NFL\u2019s decision to remove the \u201cEND RACISM\u201d logos from the end zones, it\u2019s somewhat surprising the league kept on with the song \u2013 one of their big concessions to come out of Colin Kaepernick kneeling to bring awareness to social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. Kendrick vs Drake! Taylor vs Trump! That team vs that other team! Here\u2019s a look at what you can expect from tonight: Spotted: one Taylor Swift. Outfit judgment forthcoming. Ahead of the game, in the latest move of what is shaping up to be the greatest Oscar campaign in recent memory, Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet managed to get in a car with Kendrick Lamar to talk shop. And be a fan boy, of course. Full clip below: There are multiple non-football celebrities already in attendance, close-ish the normies. More to come \u2026 Kendrick gave a rare interview this week with Apple Music if you want to look for some clues of what to expect from tonight\u2019s performance: It\u2019s that time of year once again for our sports brethren to focus on the big game and for us to focus on everything else. The Super Bowl is of course primarily about football, but for us it\u2019s about the culture surrounding it. This year will see a more star-packed bundle of expensive ads than ever before with celebrities such as Charli xcx and Ben Affleck, the re-appearance of Taylor Swift and whichever big-name friends she brings along, and, most importantly, recent Grammy winner Kendrick Lamar taking over the half-time show. It\u2019s set to be an exciting night for many Americans and a hellish night for one Canadian (will Lamar perform his controversial Drake diss track to the biggest crowd of his life?) and we will be here to cover every little non-sport moment of the night, so stay tuned.",

        "headline": "The love that dare not speak its name: why I\u2019m coming out as a gay man who loves Taylor Swift | Joe Stone",
        "trailText": "She is tragically mainstream, allergic to \u2018serving\u2019 on the red carpet and certainly hasn\u2019t thrived against the odds. It\u2019s the antithesis of gay culture \u2013 so why do I love her?",
        "bodyText": "As a self-evidently gay man, I\u2019ve generally been spared the awkwardness of coming out. That was, until I became a Swiftie. In recent years I have become adept at gauging the temperature of a room before revealing my predilection. Is this a safe space? Will I be sidelined or treated as a pervert because of who I choose to love? Should I lie, or just be evasive? I want to live authentically, but at what cost? Taylor Swift is at once the closest thing we have to a monoculture and the most divisive pop star of modern times. As a self-identified Swiftie, I believe her gift lies in the ability to take hyper-specific experiences and render them universal. I\u2019ve never performed a 149-date world tour while reeling from the heartbreak of having been ghosted by Matty Healy of the 1975, but listening to I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, her song about that indignity, has helped me put on a brave face when faced by life\u2019s more quotidian challenges. By writing a 10-minute epic about her three-month fling with Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor gives fans space to mourn our own failed situationships or private disappointments \u2013 however fleeting or insignificant they may appear to others. When I come out as a Swiftie, I\u2019m generally met by one of two reactions. It\u2019s either \u201cshe saved my life\u201d or \u201care you joking?\u201d Gay men tend to lean towards the latter. This despite being a demographic typically enthralled by female pop stars, whether they\u2019re \u201cmain pop girls\u201d or had two \u201cblink and you miss them\u201d hits 15 years ago (Alexis Jordan, thank you for your service). I\u2019ve tangled with what makes Taylor an exception to this rule. Gay culture thrives on camp and irony, whereas Taylor is aggressively earnest. Her music is designed less for the club and more for yearning over a boy you double-messaged in 2015 and never heard back from. Typically, gay men like to be perceived as tastemakers, considering anything once cool to be tragic the second it hits the mainstream. We police celebrities with the same critical eye that we cast on ourselves (try having self-esteem when gay Twitter has you convinced that Chris Pratt has a \u201cdad bod\u201d). Taylor is unavoidably uncool: the consensus is that she is allergic to \u201cserving\u201d on a red carpet and has a charming dorkiness which no cavalry of stylists seems equipped to eradicate. From Judy Garland to Britney Spears, gay men tend to idolise stars with tragic backstories, equating their struggles with our own, and finding strength in their strength. Taylor is the furthest thing from an underdog. While Mariah Carey says her sister attempted to pimp her when she was 12, Taylor was raised by bankers on a Christmas tree farm and given a gender-neutral name in order to succeed in corporate America (as she arguably has). Her own perceived sense of victimhood centres on tales of high school ostracism and being interrupted by Kanye West at an awards show in 2009 \u2013 an event that has been referenced on four of her subsequent albums, most recently last year. (OK, maybe there is something inherently camp about publicly nursing a 16-year grudge.) Unlike Madonna or Lady Gaga, she hasn\u2019t explicitly cultivated a gay audience. Her 2006 debut included the lyric: \u201cSo go and tell your friends that I\u2019m obsessive and crazy / That\u2019s fine,\u205fI\u2019ll\u205ftell\u205fmine you\u2019re gay.\u201d That version was withdrawn, resulting in a much-memed eBay listing for a \u201cTaylor Swift debut CD (homophobic version)\u201d. In 2019, she was inspired to write the Lover single You Need to Calm Down after a friend pointed out that her position on gay rights was unclear. With lyrics such as \u201cWhy are you mad when you could be GLAAD?\u201d \u2013 referencing the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation \u2013 the result was well-meaning but heavy-handed. She played New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn for a surprise Pride month performance, but her activism stalled soon after. In a relative absence of a consistent stance on the matter, some Swifties \u2013 or \u201cgaylors\u201d \u2013 have constructed elaborate conspiracy theories about a supposed secret relationship between Taylor and supermodel (and former BFF) Karlie Kloss (arguably two of the straightest women to have ever lived). I wonder whether the resistance goes deeper. Gay culture encourages us to evolve, reinvent and leave the past behind: if society says you are unworthy for long enough, you start to believe it. The skinny bullied child transforms into a muscled Adonis, essentially becoming the boys we feared in high school. Taylor\u2019s Eras tour embraced all her previous incarnations, however messy or cringe those teenage corkscrew curls and fairytale ballgowns were. Perhaps her refusal to erase her awkward history is confronting for her gay male fans to witness. What if we could all regard our past selves, however naive or clumsy, with tenderness instead of embarrassment? I love being queer. But being in gay spaces can evoke complicated feelings. There\u2019s joy at having found a sense of belonging that many of us were denied growing up, coupled with the insecurities that arise when a traumatised community starts to eat itself \u2013 imposing impossible standards about what counts as hot, aspirational or cool. For me, watching the Eras tour was a comparatively simple pleasure. Surrounded by demented Swifties as I honked along to We Are Never Getting Back Together, I was undeniably cringe. But for three hours, I was free.",

        "bodyText": "It\u2019s our first Christmas here at the Filter, and like Santa\u2019s elves, we\u2019ve been working our socks off to find this year\u2019s best gifts so you can sweep in and take the glory at the last minute. We\u2019ve found covetable items for everyone, from your tricky tween to your spoilt swimmer, and our collection of more than 900 (!!) gift ideas will help you polish off Christmas shopping faster than ever before. Thousands of you have already been busy ticking gifts off wishlists. In fact, so many of you bought your resident Swiftie the stickers we recommended that they sold out (although there are plenty of similar sets still available). And we already knew you loved this super-affordable reading light (as we mentioned last month), but we were staggered by how many flew off the shelves when we suggested it as a Secret Santa gift. If you\u2019ve still got a few difficult people to shop for (or need a treat yourself), read on for more inspiration. *** The best socks on the high street Uniqlo Heattech socks \u00a37.90 at Uniqlo Uniqlo\u2019s high-quality yet ultra-affordable basics are a favourite among our fashion team \u2013 and our readers. \u201cUniqlo makes the best socks on the high street,\u201d Guardian senior fashion writer Lauren Cochrane said in our Christmas gift mega list. \u201cA Heattech pair in a seasonal red would be very welcomed.\u201d This seasonal red proved so popular that it\u2019s now out of stock \u2013 but the muted olive and navy shades will keep feet toasty far beyond the Christmas season. For more socks, see our guide to the best socks to give this Christmas. *** Meat thermometer ThermoPro TP03H \u00a39.99 at Amazon We asked top chefs and food writers for their foodie gift ideas, from Georgina Hayden\u2019s go-to Microplane grater to Andi Oliver\u2019s fancy HexClad pan. But your favourite was this super-cheap yet eminently practical gadget. \u201cTo anyone nervous about cooking, particularly seafood and meat, I always recommend an inexpensive digital meat probe,\u201d said Paul Ainsworth, chef-owner of Paul Ainsworth At No6 in Padstow, and author of For the Love of Food. \u201cIt will give exact results every time, from cooking steaks to not overcooking fish.\u201d *** Eye cream for tired eyes The Inkey List Caffeine eye cream 15ml \u00a39.99 at Amazon Puffy, tired-looking eyes are common during the festive party season, and we have a suspicion that some of you may have bought this as a gift for yourself. \u201cLike a shot of espresso for tired eyes, this antioxidant-rich eye cream has a wonderfully light texture,\u201d says beauty and wellness expert Hayley Spencer in our roundup of the best self-care gifts. This affordable eye cream from bargain skincare brand The Inkey List \u201cbrightens and reduces pigmentation under the eyes with the help of peptides (repairing proteins) and caffeine\u201d. *** Luxe-look tray John Lewis x Collagerie Jaipur Rose lacquer tray \u00a325 at John Lewis The result of \u201ca highly covetable collab\u201d with John Lewis, this tray taps into \u201cthe vibrant, bohemian aesthetic\u201d of the former Vogue fashion directors behind Collagerie.

        "headline": "I was knocked over at a Taylor Swift show and ended up with concussion",
        "trailText": "While I was queueing at Wembley, I was struck by a falling barrier and hit my head on some concrete",
        "bodyText": "I was queueing to get into the Taylor Swift concert at Wembley Stadium in August when a gust of wind blew a metal barrier into me, knocking me over. I hit my head on concrete. Police and stewards asked me if I wanted a paramedic but, in my shock, I declined and went to the toilets to recover. I started to feel faint and in pain and was checked by first aiders and an onsite doctor who diagnosed concussion. I felt so unwell I had to go home, missing the concert. At work the next day, I was still light-headed and in pain, and was advised by a 111 call operator to go to A&amp;E. Hospital doctors confirmed concussion. My headache worsened over the next three days, I attended A&amp;E again for checks and had to take two days off work. I\u2019ve since complained to Wembley by email, by the web portal and by two signed-for letters, but have had no reply. PV, London You bought the \u00a3390 VIP ticket with money from your 21st birthday and tell me it felt a dream come true. It\u2019s worrying that the metal barrier was so poorly secured that it could be toppled by a gust, but accidents happen. What concerns me most is the apparent lack of care shown by the venue afterwards. You say that no one offered you assistance to get home \u2013 a funded taxi would have been the obvious option \u2013 or, given your worsening symptoms, suggested you go to hospital for a checkup. It\u2019s even more extraordinary that your subsequent complaints were ignored. At the very least I\u2019d have expected a written apology and a refund of the ticket price. Predictably, Wembley moved fast when I got in touch. It offered you tickets for an event of your choice plus \u201chospitality\u201d to make amends. A spokesperson said: \u201cAll accidents and incidents that take place at Wembley Stadium are reported and investigated. This matter has now been reviewed and a response sent directly to the individual concerned. We apologise for the delay.\u201d Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

        "headline": "MTV Europe awards: Taylor Swift, Raye and Pet Shop Boys are big winners in Manchester",
        "trailText": "Swift wins best artist award for third time as Liam Gallagher, Calvin Harris and Sabrina Carpenter also triumph",
        "bodyText": "There was something different about the announcements on the Manchester tram network this week. Instead of the usual voice calling out Deansgate-Castlefield and St Peter\u2019s Square, passengers have been listening to Rita Ora warning: \u201cMake sure you plan your journey \u2013 it\u2019s gonna be busy!\u201d The pop star was in Manchester on Sunday to host the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs), one of the highlights of the global music calendar, at the city\u2019s Co-op Live Arena. Featuring performances from Shawn Mendes, Raye and the South African singer Tyla, this year was the first time the EMAs was held in Manchester \u2013 arguably England\u2019s music capital \u2013 having previously travelled to Glasgow, Liverpool, Belfast and Edinburgh, as well as three visits to London since it began in 1994. During the show Ora gave an emotional tribute to the One Direction singer Liam Payne, saying: \u201cLiam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew. He had the biggest heart and was always the first person to offer help in any way that he could. \u201cHe brought so much joy to every room he walked into and he left such a mark on the world.\u201d Taylor Swift led the nominations, making an appearance in seven categories and coming away with four awards, including best artist and best video for Fortnight, her duet with Post Malone. She has become the first musician to win best artist three times, ahead of two-time best artist winner Mendes, who picked up an award this year for best Canadian artist. Swift, whose Eras tour has been the most lucrative in music history, also saw off other top female artists in a female-dominated lineup, also featuring Charli XCX and Billie Eilish. Homegrown artists triumphed too, with Raye winning best UK artist, Liam Gallagher picking up best rock artist and Calvin Harris winning best electronic artist. Best song predictably went to the song of the summer, Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, beating Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2019Em, Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck, Babe! and We Can\u2019t Be Friends by Ariana Grande. Pet Shop Boys, who picked up the Pop Pioneer award for their 40 years in the music industry, also performed, alongside a local orchestra, the Manchester Camerata. The duo are the most successful in UK music history with Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe listed in the Guinness Book of Records, achieving 44 UK Top 30 singles, including 22 Top 10 hits and four No 1s, 15 UK Top 10 studio albums and sold-out shows in 63 countries. The hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes \u2013 with an unlikely connection to the north-west of England \u2013 took home a lifetime achievement award. The musician previously spoke of spending two summers with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d he told the BBC last year. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a white and a black person go [to school] together until I came here.\u201d Accepting the award, which was presented by the British rapper Little Simz, Rhymes said: \u201cThis is my first time here. I\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty-four years of professionally recording, this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels fucking incredible.\u201d The 12-time Grammy nominee thanked his mother, who he described as his best friend and hero. Rhymes also performed a medley of his greatest hits to the crowd of 23,500, at the UK\u2019s largest indoor music venue. Broadcast live to more than 150 countries across the world, the EMAs are watched closely by the music industry as they often give a hint of which artists are lined up for success at the Grammys. The EMAs were the last in a week-long series of events in Manchester under the umbrella of MTV music week. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said: \u201cFor a long time we\u2019ve been saying that Manchester is the UK\u2019s capital of music, with a rich musical heritage stretching back decades that has helped build a vibrant, diverse music scene that continues to flourish today. \u201cHaving the MTV EMAs, music week and some of the biggest names in pop music like Rita Ora in Manchester not only helps to strengthen our claim, but it also provides a huge boost to our music industry and the wider economy.\u201d",

        "headline": "\u2018Friends keep me tethered\u2019: actor Joe Alwyn on fame, dating Taylor Swift and keeping his feet on the ground",
        "trailText": "Joe Alwyn has had an astonishing rise. After his breakthrough with Ang Lee, he wowed in Conversations with Friends and now stars in The Brutalist. Throw in his ex, Taylor Swift, and you have a redhot A-lister ready to go",
        "bodyText": "If \u2013 as projected \u2013 The Brutalist goes to the 2025 Academy Awards and cleans up, there will be some knowing, told-you-so nods from critics and industry experts. A monumental epic, the film has already earned comparisons to Citizen Kane and the Daniel Day-Lewis masterpiece There Will Be Blood. Over an engrossing three and a half hours, with an intermission, The Brutalist wrestles with the American dream, the vagaries of capitalism, the immigrant experience and antisemitism. Everyone agrees its lead, Adrien Brody, who already has a little gold statue, has never been better. The film is shot entirely on an obscure retro format, VistaVision, that hasn\u2019t been used on an American movie since 1961. Tick, tick, tick, tick: textbook Oscar-bait. Not that Joe Alwyn, 33, the British actor who also stars in The Brutalist sees it that way. \u201cTo be honest, I thought it might be a really good film that not many people would end up seeing,\u201d he says, when we hunker down for a morning coffee at a hotel in central London. Alwyn is dressed entirely in dark blue; the only flashes of colour are the laces of his hiking boots. He\u2019s over 6ft, but he slouches a little, so you wouldn\u2019t immediately know. \u201cWho knows, maybe it still will?\u201d he continues. \u201cI hope not. But given the things against it, given that it ticks most boxes of what you\u2019re not meant to make as a film these days: length, content, all of that \u2013 anything on top of that is a really nice surprise.\u201d Alwyn goes on, warming to the subject. The Brutalist was made for less than $10m, loose change by modern standards, by a director, Brady Corbet, who is unknown outside Hollywood (and not exactly famous within it). It tracks the life of a fictional austere Bauhausian architect, which might float the boat of the Modern House devotees, but feels defiantly not very mainstream. Alwyn laughs, \u201cA three-and-a-half-hour film about a Hungarian architect doesn\u2019t scream Oppenheimer!\u201d So, if Alwyn had such profound doubts about the project\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t do it?\u201d he says, finishing the thought. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t care, really. I want to, hopefully, be a part of interesting projects like that. I do think it\u2019s a great film. I want to find those people to work with and I\u2019m so happy to have found Brady.\u201d This exchange, in some ways, sums up Alwyn. In his career, he has found modest renown, often playing buttoned-up characters that he skilfully draws out with a slow-burn intensity. The template was set in his debut role, when he was picked out of nowhere \u2013 well, drama school \u2013 by director Ang Lee to star as the eponymous lead of the 2016 movie Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk. Lynn is an American war hero, but also grappling with PTSD, and Alwyn portrayed him with a wide-eyed bemusement that he must also have been feeling. That sensitivity was there again in the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s novel Conversations with Friends in 2022. There, he is Nick, a depressed 30-something actor who stumbles into a messy affair with Frances, a self-absorbed college student. But meanwhile, in Alwyn\u2019s life off-screen, very little was quiet or subdued. Around 2016, he met Taylor Swift, probably at the Met Gala in New York, and they dated for six and a half years. As a couple, they fiercely guarded their privacy \u2013 Alwyn especially \u2013 but the diehard Swifties were never going to be fobbed off with that. Swift\u2019s songs were pored over for biographical titbits, especially early hits Gorgeous, about becoming obsessed with a new boyfriend, and London Boy, where she roves around the city watching rugby in a pub and enjoying high tea. Even after their break-up in April 2023, the fascination endured: Swift\u2019s latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, read as a pointed reference to a WhatsApp group that Alwyn had with actors Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott called, jokingly, The Tortured Man Club. So, Alwyn knows fame \u2013 and also, the intense scrutiny and tedious perils that can accompany it. Perhaps for that reason, in his work, he has stealthily curated one of the more intriguing and challenging r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of any modern British actor. Strikingly handsome, with a storm of blond hair and soulful blue eyes, he would be an obvious candidate for any romantic lead. But those parts don\u2019t appear to interest him. Instead, he hunts down directors known for brilliant but offbeat films, such as Yorgos Lanthimos, Joanna Hogg, Claire Denis and Chlo\u00e9 Zhao. You imagine he would have the heft these days to insist on only central roles, but Alwyn quite often pops up in support of the likes of Emma Stone, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. We saw this last year with Kinds of Kindness, the latest from Lanthimos, the director of The Favourite and Poor Things. (Kinds of Kindness, like The Brutalist, is also a whopper, with a runtime of almost three hours: \u201cTwo long films, but not too long films,\u201d Alwyn notes.) Kinds of Kindness is a triptych fable with the same cast, including Stone, Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley, popping up in different scenarios. Alwyn\u2019s most memorable sequence comes in the final third, where he plays an estranged husband, Joseph, whose wife (Stone) runs away from him and their daughter to join a cult. Joseph decides to spike her drink, for somewhat opaque and nefarious reasons, and she is promptly sick on his bare feet. I tell Alwyn that his expression when the vomit splatters \u2013 beleaguered, accepting \u2013 really made me laugh. You can see he can\u2019t tell whether I\u2019m being genuine (I am!) and replies warily, \u201cI\u2019m glad that moment landed! Do you know what? That\u2019s why I took the job. But cold pea soup on your foot is never a nice sensation, so that was pure Daniel Day-Lewis.\u201d In The Brutalist, Alwyn is Harry, the scion of a rich industrialist (played by Guy Pearce) who first commissions the architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (Brody) to build a library for his father. He\u2019s entitled and arrogant and, we slowly learn, probably much worse besides. \u201cA bit of a wrong \u2019un, but quite an interesting wrong \u2019un,\u201d says Alwyn. He found inspiration for Harry in unexpected places. \u201cLook who\u2019s the new president of America, and his family. Often family businesses are so insular and stunted and hollow. And you see it with Trump and his children: \u2018I can do what I want.\u2019 A convicted felon accused of sexual assault and grabbing them by the pussy and all of that. He\u2019s unanswerable, unfortunately.\u201d Again, The Brutalist is a thoughtful choice for Alwyn: he is much more invested in collecting experiences and characters than pay cheques and star billing. \u201cIt feels like a no-brainer to seek out directors who I really admire and like, or just get along with, and see what that experience is like with them, whether that\u2019s as a lead or a supporting role,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really bothered me.\u201d There it is once more: the hint that accruing more fame or celebrity is almost the last thing Alwyn wants. Alwyn\u2019s break came pretty young, but it could have been even earlier. In 2002, when he was 11, he was talent-spotted in a fencing class in north London \u2013 maybe the most middle-class detail ever \u2013 to audition for the part of Sam in the Richard Curtis movie Love Actually. He did well enough to run lines with members of the cast, but he mainly remembers wanting to get back to school to watch the World Cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t audition for that because I was some child actor with an agent or something,\u201d he says. \u201cI just went to a fencing class because I was obsessed with Zorro growing up, so me and a friend started doing it in a community centre. But I was always quite shy. I wasn\u2019t a theatre kid. I\u2019m still not a theatre kid, I don\u2019t think. There\u2019s this idea that if you\u2019re an actor, you\u2019re jumping on a table and singing a song and telling every story. And, actually, the opposite is often true.\u201d Alwyn grew up in Kentish Town; his father Richard is a documentary filmmaker and lecturer, his mother Elizabeth is a psychotherapist. The connection between their lines of work and his own is not lost on Alwyn. \u201cBoth their jobs have a heavy interest in why people are the way they are,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd having empathy to explore someone or what makes us behave the way we do.\u201d Through his parents, Alwyn was introduced to classic films, from Kes to the Coen brothers. He was drawn to the subtler character actors: \u201cPhilip Seymour Hoffman, and Ben Whishaw was a big one as a teenager. I saw him as Hamlet when I was 13 or something, and probably not really understanding the play at all, but being like, \u2018Whatever that is, that\u2019s cool. I\u2019ll have that.\u2019\u201d And Alwyn loved comedy. \u201cThere\u2019s probably rarely a day in my life that goes by when I don\u2019t think of The Office.\u201d Alwyn studied English and drama at Bristol university, before winning a place at the Central School of Speech and Drama. He was in his final year there when an agent took him on and put him forward for the new Ang Lee film. It would prove to be a life-changing moment. \u201cIt was completely mad,\u201d Alwyn recalls. \u201cAnd I feel really lucky. It\u2019s not lost to me that I owe everything to him and that casting director. I really do. Every door that has opened is down to that. It was such a special experience. I\u2019d never been to America. I\u2019d never been in front of a camera before.\u201d Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk was not a smash at the box office: nothing to do with Alwyn; it was just perhaps a bit too contemplative for what audiences were expecting from a war film. But he looks back on the experience with only fondness. \u201cEverything about it was extreme: going to a new country, going to military boot camp, having your hair shaved off, doing an American accent, bulking up, everything was extreme. It\u2019s still the most special experience of being a part of a project. I feel like I\u2019ve been chasing that feeling since and have also simultaneously realised it\u2019s not going to be the same, because that was the first ever time. And so it\u2019s become coloured by other things and that\u2019s OK as well.\u201d Is Alwyn talking about being in the public glare? \u201cYeah, that first time I had no idea about everything else that comes with it. That you have to do press for it and there\u2019s expectations, or there\u2019s not expectations. Or it could lead to this, or it won\u2019t lead to this. All of that wasn\u2019t there and that was great.\u201d Alwyn doesn\u2019t make the link explicit, but everything changed after Billy Lynn not just because of the film, but mainly because he became half of one of the world\u2019s most scrutinised couples. Did he fear that his relationship with Swift would overshadow his career? \u201cI have tried just to focus on controlling what I can control,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd, right from the beginning, tried to focus on the things that are meaningful for me: friends, family, work, of course. So noise outside of that, I think I\u2019ve done what lots of people who find themselves in the public eye do, which is just try and ignore it. If you don\u2019t, and if you let all of that other stuff in, and if it starts to affect you and your behaviour, you\u2019re living from the outside in. And then you\u2019re pretty fucked.\u201d That sounds exhausting, I suggest. \u201cI have great family and friends and real things in my life; those are the things that kept me tethered to the ground,\u201d Alwyn insists. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know how else to say it, it\u2019s\u2026 just in a different room.\u201d The apex of the fascination with Alwyn and Swift came in 2020 around the release of her albums Folklore, which won three Grammys, and its follow-up Evermore, conceived and made during lockdown. Alwyn has two writing credits on the former, three on the latter (under the pseudonym William Bowery): the transcendent, melancholic ballad Exile, from Folklore, which ended up as a duet with Bon Iver, came from Alwyn messing around on the piano and being overheard by Swift. \u201cLockdown was a whole host of surprises and that was pretty special,\u201d says Alwyn. \u201cThat was not something I would have foreseen.\u201d He has a Grammy now \u2013 only an Emmy, Oscar and Tony and he\u2019ll have an EGOT: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just breeze through those,\u201d he replies, wryly. When I put it to Alwyn that he must just want to move on, he pushes back: he has moved on. \u201cThat\u2019s something for other people to do,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about something that\u2019s a while ago now in my life. So that\u2019s for other people. That\u2019s what I feel.\u201d Certainly 2025 is looking bright for Alwyn. After The Brutalist, he has the two Hams: an adaptation of Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet, made by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, one of only three women to have won an Oscar for Best Director, also starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley; and Hamlet, in which he is Laertes opposite Riz Ahmed\u2019s Dane. Alwyn is always wary of speculating on an end product he hasn\u2019t seen yet, but both projects fulfil his criteria of working with people he admires on scripts that somehow stop him in his tracks. \u201cI always feel optimistic at the top of a new year,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, I feel great, I feel lucky to be in a good place.\u201d For Alwyn, the dream is always to rediscover the time when nobody knew who he was or cared what he was doing beyond what was being projected on the screen. \u201cYou have to dupe yourself,\u201d he says, of being an actor. \u201cYou have to fight away things in order to hold on to what is essentially a childlike playfulness. Bat away the industry of it. Or cynicism or self-consciousness, in order to put yourself in a place where you are willing to run around like a kid and pretend that you\u2019re someone you\u2019re not for a few months.\u201d Alwyn snaps back to the real world and smiles, \u201cWhich sounds very sane.\u201d The Brutalist is in cinemas from 24 January Fashion editor Helen Seamons; grooming by Paul Donovan using Patricks; fashion assistant Sam Deaman; photography assistants Tom Frimley and Claudia Gschwend \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2025.

        "headline": "\u2018Will I cry? Yes!\u2019 Taylor Swift\u2019s era-defining Eras tour comes to a close",
        "trailText": "After 149 shows, Swift\u2019s global tour has been the most successful of all time. At the final dates, fans explain their devotion",
        "bodyText": "By now, nearly 21 months after Taylor Swift launched what would become the highest-grossing tour of all time, you could be forgiven for thinking both \u201cwait, Taylor Swift is still on the Eras Tour?\u201d or that the globe-spanning, headline-dominating, literally seismic show would go on for ever. After all, the Eras era has spanned an epoch, at least in ever-quickening internet time. But after 149 shows, 10-plus million fans and several pop cultural takeovers, the Eras Tour reached the end of its road in fittingly rainy Vancouver, having become the highest-grossing tour of all time at over $2bn. Not that you would know it from downtown, which \u2013 like every city before it in the US, Australia, Asia, Europe and finally Canada \u2013 morphed into a temporary mecca for hundreds of thousands of sequined, jubilant Swifties. Much has been said about how the Eras Tour became its own two-year economic stimulus, but it is still staggering to witness Swiftonomics in person. According to the unscientific estimate of a US border agent who asked me how Taylor was before even looking at my passport, \u201c99.5%\u201d of vehicles crossing between the US and Canada this weekend were heading to and from the three shows. (Perhaps he saw all the friendship bracelets passed between cars in traffic). Light-up lyrics adorned the streets leading to BC Place; you could not go to a Starbucks in town without seeing women in Eras Tour merchandise. \u201cThe energy is just \u2026 I think everybody is feeling it,\u201d said Maline Davis, 27, of St Louis, Missouri, at a loss for words over the last show. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I just don\u2019t know that this will happen again.\u201d Probably not, at least not in this way. The Eras Tour \u2013 a stupefying spectacle of ambition, self-mythology and sheer prodigiousness that covers somewhere between 45 and 50 songs in three and a half hours \u2013 was a special alchemy of ridiculously prolific artist, uniquely devout fanbase, mass cultural appeal and simmering desire to return to large concerts post-Covid. With it, Swift redefined the scope of a music tour: how much money it could make, how much extra-textual lore it could produce and absorb, how long it could last. I reviewed the first show in March 2023 in Glendale, Arizona, way back when TikTokers predicted a two-hour show. That night, the friend I took with me told me she was pregnant; her daughter is now a walking, talking toddler. In that period, Swift inadvertently challenged the monopoly of Ticketmaster/LiveNation, headlined the first billion-dollar tour (total revenue figures have not yet been released) and turned the show into an industry-shifting concert film. The Eras Tour mutated to include a new album, a new boyfriend and new rereleases in Swift\u2019s ongoing quest to reclaim ownership of (and evermore attention on) her back catalogue. She became both the mainstream and social media main character of 2023, careened through overexposure and landed in the astral plane of uncharted, generally unfathomable mega-celebrity. The Eras Tour \u201cjust took over everything. It was all everyone could talk about\u201d, said Davis\u2019s sister Addie, 24. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that this is the last weekend.\u201d For the entirety of its run, getting tickets was an infamously gruelling gauntlet and, for many, the final dates were less sentimental than practical. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even realise that it was going to be the last weekend,\u201d said Hayley, 19, who came with her family from Dayton, Ohio, after they were unable to get tickets for the regional show in Cincinnati. Danielle Barnard was supposed to attend a London show in June with her 13-year-old daughter, Emerson, but couldn\u2019t fly from Seattle after Emerson, who has a heart condition, suffered a cardiac arrest. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to get her here, after everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to celebrate.\u201d Cora, 31, of Vancouver, made it to her first show a year after she \u201cwon the great war\u201d on Ticketmaster. \u201cI would never say I\u2019m a 10/10 [Swiftie], because I wouldn\u2019t sell a limb,\u201d she said of her devotion, \u201cbut did I spend a lot of money and will I cry? Yes.\u201d Everyone, without fail, had already seen the show, whether via the concert film or the millions of recordings chopped and lavished and dissected online. Outside the stadiums, these recordings became a type of post-reality TV \u2013 the Eras Tour as an ever-mutating, interactive, increasingly meta show producing new lore each week that Swift folded back into the tour. Starting with this summer\u2019s European leg, the modified set list includes The Tortured Poets Department, the record-breaking album she released in April that reveals, in typical diaristic fashion, the artist\u2019s personal tumult during the glittering, seemingly triumphant early era of the Eras Tour. It is surreal to watch Swift sing I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, a shimmering ode to how functionally depressed she was during the early shows, as she was telling fans she was having the time of her life, to the same fans who watched the whole time. If anything, the dissonance intensified the reverence. In its second year, the Eras Tour settled into a semi-religious event. Fans ritualised the show with Rocky Horror-esque timed participation \u2013 when to shout out unofficial additional lyrics, when to hold up one\u2019s phone flashlight (and, for the track Willow, a little balloon over the flashlight). When to give the eardrum-shattering, minutes-long ovation so that Swift can bask, earpieces out, in the worship that she built. \u201cI decided to make this tour the longest tour I\u2019ve ever done because you have made this feel like so much more than a concert tour,\u201d she said on stage Friday night. And by all measures \u2013 crowd size, profit, set list, content creation, fan devotion \u2013 it was. I watched a Swiftie boyfriend delete photos on his phone to make room to record the whole show. Multiple people Facetimed loved ones in. Others screamed every word in a familiar yet still unbelievable swirl of ecstatic sound. \u201cI didn\u2019t record much this time, because I wanted to just take it in,\u201d said Maline Davis. I did, too, with my childhood best friend, and left feeling dazed \u2013 by the brain-scorching screams, by the baffling passage of time, by the incomprehensible scale of it all, by the end of an era. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 December 2024. An earlier subheading said that Taylor Swift performed 152 shows when it should have said 149.",

        "trailText": "Global chart dominated by US acts including Benson Boone, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Sabrina Carpenter, with K-pop bands also strong",
        "bodyText": "British pop stars have failed to reach the worldwide annual charts of the year\u2019s Top 10 biggest singles and albums for the first time in more than two decades. In 2022, UK acts such as Harry Styles and Glass Animals made up seven of the 20 entries in the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) list. This year, the leading UK act was producer and singer Artemas, for I Like the Way You Kiss Me. British stars such as Charli xcx \u2013 arguably the most conversation-dominating UK act of 2024, with her album Brat \u2013 Dua Lipa and Coldplay did not feature. It is the first time since 2003 that a UK act hasn\u2019t featured in either the singles or albums list. The No 1 song globally was Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, and the No 1 album globally was The Tortured Poets Department by Taylor Swift. K-pop boybands dominated the albums list, with two entries from Seventeen (Spill the Feels at No 6 and 17 Is Right Here at No 8), along with Enhypen (Romance: Untold at No 4) and Stray Kids (ATE at No 10). The remainder of the list came from US superstars: Hit Me Hard and Soft by Billie Eilish (No 2), Short n\u2019 Sweet by Sabrina Carpenter (No 3), SOS by SZA (No 5), One Thing at a Time by Morgan Wallen (No 7) and Stick Season by Noah Kahan (No 9). In the singles chart, only Irish songwriter Hozier, with Too Sweet at No 6, deviated from the otherwise total US dominance of the list, which spanned pop (Carpenter\u2019s Espresso at No 2) to rap-country (Post Malone and Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help at No 7) and a five-year-old song by Swift, Cruel Summer, at No 9. The insistence of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s blockbuster Drake diss track, Not Like Us, was confirmed as it appeared at No 8. Jo Twist, chief executive of British record industry body the BPI, told the BBC: \u201cBritish artists may have enjoyed stronger years on the international stage, which perhaps isn\u2019t surprising given some of our biggest names were not in cycle in 2024. \u201cThere was still plenty to be excited about, as a new generation announced itself \u2013 not least Charli xcx, who enjoyed a breakthrough year globally, alongside international chart success for emerging artists such as Jordan Adetunji, Artemas and Good Neighbours, while the likes of Lola Young and Myles Smith are now rapidly building an international following.\u201d Twist said that it is \u201cundoubtedly becoming much harder to break talent in a hyper-competitive global music economy\u201d. The news comes ahead of the Brit awards this weekend, led by xcx with five nominations for Brat, followed by Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith with four.

        "trailText": "Pop singer\u2019s 149-date tour, which ended on Sunday in Vancouver, more than doubles the previous record for a completed tour",
        "bodyText": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour has been confirmed as the most commercially successful tour of all time, raking in more than twice as much revenue as the previous record-holder. Following the tour\u2019s final date in Vancouver on Sunday, the singer\u2019s company Taylor Swift Touring confirmed the final revenue tally to the New York Times: $2,077,618,725 (\u00a31.62bn). This is the first official disclosure of the tour\u2019s revenue figures. That eclipses the previous record for a completed tour, namely Elton John\u2019s Farewell Yellow Brick Road which accrued $939m. Swift also managed to generate her astonishing revenue with considerably fewer shows: 149 to Elton John\u2019s 330. Coldplay\u2019s ongoing Music of the Spheres tour has meanwhile passed the $1bn mark, and with concerts booked into mid-2025, could rival Swift\u2019s tally if they continue to add extra dates. Eras was a critical as well as commercial success, with no less than four five-star Guardian reviews as it made its way around the world. Swift performed songs from all of her albums in concerts of more than three and a half hours, and between legs of the tour, managed to also find time to write and record her new studio album The Tortured Poets Department, which became a feature of the later tour dates after its release in April. Tickets averaged out at a cost of $204 each across the entirety of the tour, a relatively high price point that is testament to how invested \u2013 in every sense \u2013 Swift\u2019s fanbase is. The demand was so great for tickets when they went on sale in November 2022 that Ticketmaster\u2019s system collapsed as 3.5bn ticket requests were made, precipitating a US Senate hearing over its parent company Live Nation\u2019s position in the ticketing market, with senators alleging a monopoly. London\u2019s Wembley Stadium was the venue that hosted the most fans overall, with 753,112 attending across eight dates. The highest single concert attendance was 96,006, for one of her three dates at Melbourne Cricket Ground. The $2bn-plus figure does not take into account the considerable revenue generated by merchandise sales, with vast pop-up shops erected outside venues to sell hoodies, friendship bracelets and more. A concert film released in October 2023 generated $261m in box office revenue: a record for a concert film, eclipsing the $99m generated by Justin Bieber\u2019s Never Say Never in 2011. The Eras tour film was later made available to stream on Disney+, with anonymous sources reported by Variety claiming the deal was worth $75m.",

        "trailText": "It\u2019s tough to call the quality-stacked top categories, featuring Academy darlings such as Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift alongside pop\u2019s new tyros",
        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink). Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best country solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 16 Carriages Jelly Roll \u2013 I Am Not Okay Kacey Musgraves \u2013 The Architect Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Chris Stapleton \u2013 It Takes a Woman In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "trailText": "Pop may be full of solo artists and individually tailored streams, but the Eras tour, Brat summer and Oasis reunion showed we still long to be part of a crowd",
        "bodyText": "The past year brought with it intriguing musical movements, not least a sudden pivot towards country by a succession of mainstream pop stars. Heralded by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Carter album and amplified by the release of Post Malone\u2019s F-1 Trillion, the trend also brought huge hits for the hitherto-unknown Shaboozey and Dasha, while Zayn Malik called on the services of a Nashville producer and Lana Del Rey announced a country-influenced album. 2024 also brought with it new stars, most obviously Chappell Roan, who had spent the best part of a decade plugging away in obscurity, being signed then dropped by a major label, before releasing a debut album that slow-burned its way to the top of the charts: The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess initially came out in 2023 to little response (one of its biggest hits, Pink Pony Club, was first released four years ago). As with Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 whose 2024 breakthrough Short N\u2019 Sweet was her sixth album \u2013 Roan had clearly had the space to work out exactly what she wanted to do and how she wanted to present herself, with appealingly idiosyncratic and uncontrived results. But the most striking thing about pop in 2024 was the way it was dominated by a handful of huge, monocultural stories, which spilled out of the music pages into the mainstream news agenda. Continuing from 2023, Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour began the year being described as bigger than the Beatles and Thriller by support act Phoebe Bridgers and ended it officially the highest-grossing tour in history, making Swift a billionaire in the process. By the time it arrived in the UK this summer, the clamour made it impossible to avoid. But it was superseded in the headlines by the release of Charli xcx\u2019s Brat and the announcement we were living through a \u201cBrat summer\u201d: whatever the rather nebulous concept of being \u201cbrat\u201d signified, the idea took dramatic hold, turning up everywhere from the US election campaign to the New Statesman\u2019s posthumous appreciation of Edna O\u2019Brien and the pages of National Geographic, which proclaimed Cleopatra, Lucrezia Borgia and 7th-century Chinese empress Wu Zetian were all \u201cbrat\u201d. Then Oasis announced their 2025 reunion tour. For weeks, it was unavoidable: loud and lengthy expressions of joy; equally loud and lengthy expressions of horror; controversy regarding ticket prices; rosy-hued 90s nostalgia; bitter recriminations regarding the failings of 90s pop culture; and explorations of the curious phenomenon of teenagers too young to remember Oasis\u2019s 2009 split, let alone their golden years, yet apparently thrilled by their reappearance. On the face of it, these three mega-stories were all quite different. The Eras tour had a sense of finality \u2013 it was difficult for even the most hysterical devotee to see how Swift could possibly top this career-summarising greatest hits show. The success of Brat, meanwhile, seemed to herald a new era in mainstream pop that was messier, brasher, wittier and wilfully trashier, a reaction to years of self-help platitudes, wellness culture and perfectly choreographed pop. (You could see something similar in Roan\u2019s drag-inspired aesthetic \u2013 the cover of her single Good Luck, Babe! had her sporting a prosthetic pig\u2019s snout \u2013 and in Carpenter\u2019s gleefully acidic lyrics.) At the risk of sounding like the writer trying to crowbar Charli xcx into a piece about Edna O\u2019Brien, one could argue the V-flicking Gallaghers are, well, brat; if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to wellness culture and self-care bromides, they\u2019ve got a song called Cigarettes and Alcohol that\u2019s very much in favour of both. But their reunion was still predicated on nostalgia, with even teenage fans buying into a myth of the 90s as a kind of prelapsarian age, before social media and smartphones, that was less fraught than the present day. And yet, all three stories had something in common. For years now, pop has favoured the individual over the collective \u2013 this year groups such as Flo have continued to struggle, and some of the biggest global hits were from newly solo K-pop stars such as Jimin of BTS and Ros\u00e9 and Lisa of Blackpink \u2013 and the way pop is consumed has also narrowed. Streaming\u2019s algorithms serve up music ostensibly tailored to your own personal tastes. The price of tickets has turned gig-going into a special occasion you indulge in once or twice a year rather than enjoy on a regular basis. Fandoms have become weird, often troubling things that seem to exist as disembodied online entities firing pissy, anonymous social media messages to their idol\u2019s rivals. The things music fans used to gather around \u2013 TV and radio shows, the music press, even the charts \u2013 are either fading in importance or essentially defunct. Yet there remains an innate desire for collective experience, for music to provide a sense of community. You could see it in the burgeoning popularity of dance music: a DJ like Sammy Virji may have made little impact on the charts, but he can still sell out two nights at Brixton Academy; the nocturnal dance events at Glastonbury were so over-subscribed, some had to be closed down due to overcrowding. You could see it in the crowds that flocked to the Eras gigs, who seemed noticeably different from other pop audiences, and were big on intriguingly homespun rituals \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if Swift or her management had told them to come in costume, or trade friendship bracelets, or draw the number 13 on their hands, or develop a series of if-you-know-you-know responses to particular moments in certain songs. You could see it in a willingness to buy into the notion of Brat and Brat summer, a way of defining yourself, however nebulously, through music in a post-tribal era, when pop is supposed to have lost its ability to affect the way its audience defines itself. And you could see it in the commotion caused by the return of Oasis. Whatever else you make of it, Oasis\u2019s oeuvre is absolutely predicated on collective experience: their songs sound like songs written specifically for vast crowds of people to bellow along to en masse; they\u2019re probably best experienced in the middle of said crowd, drunk, with your arms around your friends. Indeed, collective experience is so entrenched in Oasis\u2019s appeal that their music has literally become a signifier of it. In recent years, advertisers have reached for Stand By Me and Round Are Way in commercials tagged, respectively \u201cit\u2019s a people thing\u201d and \u201cwe can all do our bit for our community\u201d. So perhaps that\u2019s the underlying message of pop in 2024: people still want to be part of something bigger than themselves, and they\u2019ll still use pop to do it, even in an age when audiences are supposed to be atomised and individually sated by the algorithm. If it is, that\u2019s a hopeful note to end a frequently hopeless year on.",

        "trailText": "Charli xcx, Taylor Swift, George Clooney and Beyonc\u00e9 all voiced their approval for the Democratic candidate. But do these endorsements do more for the stars than for the politician?",
        "bodyText": "Back in July, Charli xcx posted a three-word tweet that some commentators thought might help swing the US election. Arriving the day after Kamala Harris announced her bid for the presidency, Charli\u2019s tweet said simply: \u201cKamala IS Brat.\u201d It was a reference to Charli\u2019s latest album, Brat, which had dominated the pop cultural landscape all summer and was loaded with synth-pop bangers, drug references and tales from a life spent getting messy on dancefloors. It wasn\u2019t perhaps the most obvious comparison to make with the then 59-year-old US vice-president, but the overall meaning was clear: Kamala was the presidential candidate with the most energy and authenticity \u2013 and had the approval of the pop star of the moment. The Harris campaign leaned into the endorsement, changing the backdrop of its official X page to the same garish green colour used on the record\u2019s sleeve. It helped mark Harris out as a different, more dynamic candidate than her faltering predecessor: Joe Biden may have been many things but he was most certainly not Brat. Yet as the dust settles on an extremely depressing election result, it appears clear that not only did Charli xcx\u2019s tweet have no meaningful impact on the election result, nor did the endorsement of any celebrity. Just look at the list of backers lined up for Harris. Taylor Swift, the world\u2019s biggest popstar, came out for her after the September debate, writing that Harris \u201cfights for the rights and causes I believe\u201d and signing off as a \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d \u2013 a dig at comments made by Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick JD Vance. Harrison Ford recorded a video, looking grave as he warned voters about what a danger Trump would be to democracy. And then there was Beyonc\u00e9, who even appeared at one of Harris\u2019s rallies, alongside fellow Destiny\u2019s Child member Kelly Rowland. Speaking from the stage, Beyonc\u00e9 said she was there \u201cas a mother who cares deeply about a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we\u2019re not divided\u201d. You can add to these names endorsements from the likes of LeBron James, George Clooney, Bruce Springsteen, Oprah, Lizzo, J-Lo, Eminem, Arnold Schwarzenegger and countless more. Game, set and match to Harris? Hardly. So why did their voices have so little impact? Seth Abramovitch, senior writer at the Hollywood Reporter, says that Harris\u2019s nominations were ineffective because they came largely from celebrities who were preaching to the choir: \u201cOprah, Katy Perry, Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Ariana Grande \u2013 these are artists whose audiences (black, female, liberal, queer) were already inclined to vote for Kamala.\u201d The exception to this, he says, was Swift, whose popularity in the worlds of country music and pop means she appeals to both sides of a divided US. \u201cYet I\u2019d argue her massive influence does not reach two key demographic groups that helped Trump win this time \u2013 Latinos and black men.\u201d Margaretha Bentley is a professor at Arizona State University whose classes have studied the social importance of Swift. \u201cIn the academic literature,\u201d she says, \u201cresearch has shown that, while celebrity endorsements can increase civic engagement and voter registrations, it has not proven to have a direct impact on how people make their voting decisions.\u201d Bentley likes to ask her students what influences their vote, and the overwhelming majority of responses mention family (especially parents), friends and personal values. \u201cVoters may do more research after a celebrity endorses, but they will vote based on their own values and not necessarily the values of the celebrity endorser.\u201d Recent data seem to back that up. The vote.gov website received 405,999 visitors in the 24 hours after Swift shared its URL with her followers. \u201cThere is robust evidence that celebrities do have a real impact in promoting overall, nonpartisan civic engagement \u2013 from encouraging voter registration to poll worker signups,\u201d says Ashley Spillane who authored Celebrities Strengthening Our Culture of Democracy, a Harvard study published in August. But the same report also found that it was hard to quantify whether an increased drive of voters to the polls corresponded with positive outcomes for the endorsed candidate. So if people are not going to vote in the way the endorsed campaign wants, is there any actual value in seeking out an endorsement? \u201cThat\u2019s a great question and one that the research has not fully been able to answer,\u201d says Bentley. \u201cFrom my standpoint, as an educator, if celebrity endorsements encourage civic engagement, then that is a good thing.\u201d Of course, courting celebrities is nothing new. Ahead of the 1920 election, Al Jolson led a march of fellow actors through the streets of Ohio in support of Republican Warren G Harding\u2019s bid, and even penned what became the official campaign song. Endorsements from Babe Ruth, Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand have all been coveted by the candidates of their day \u2013 and possibly with good reason. A 2008 study by Northwestern University, for instance, claimed that Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement of Barack Obama added around a million votes to his final tally. But that was in a very different political landscape. A poll from YouGov shortly after Swift\u2019s endorsement found that only 8% of voters would be \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cmuch more\u201d likely to vote for Harris \u2013 with a surprising 20% saying the endorsement actually made them less likely to vote for her. Has there been a recent shift in the way we view celebrity endorsements? Laurence F Maslon, an arts professor at New York University, doesn\u2019t believe so. \u201cI think endorsements have probably always done more for the celebrity than the person being endorsed. I think sometimes it\u2019s a way to hitch your star to somebody who seems to be good for you, and maybe there\u2019s a certain kind of reflected glory in that,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you look at, say, Sinatra\u2019s endorsement of John F Kennedy, that was probably more of a big deal for Sinatra, because it allowed him to get a seat at the table and he probably thought it would help him achieve that next level of stardom.\u201d Still, Maslon accepts that there has been a concerted effort by the Republican party over the past few decades to counter the fact that Democrats receive the biggest celebrity endorsements. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a Republican candidate for any office in the last 20 years who didn\u2019t append the word liberal before the word Hollywood when speaking about it,\u201d he says. Ultimately, it means a celebrity endorsement becomes baked into the overall discourse. \u201cPeople like George Clooney and Robert De Niro, I mean, who cares, frankly?\u201d Certainly, Republicans have made a great deal out of the idea of \u201celites\u201d in recent years, feeding into the idea that what works for a celebrity is not necessarily what\u2019s in the best interests of the average person on the street. Beyonc\u00e9, the argument goes, is hardly likely to be worrying about the price of gas. The view that celebrities are so divorced from real life that they\u2019re not worth listening to is encapsulated by a brief Ricky Gervais video posted in June, which resurfaced as a viral meme just before the election: \u201cAs a celebrity, I know all about stuff like science and politics so trust me when I tell you who you should vote for,\u201d Gervais says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote the right way, it\u2019s like a hate crime and that makes me sad and angry and I\u2019ll leave the country and you don\u2019t want that.\u201d You may find that view of democracy \u2013 that we all know so little we should refrain from using our voices \u2013 unbelievably cynical. But it taps into a backlash against endorsements that, in recent years, has taken a darker turn with the rise of QAnon and other conspiracy theories regarding the alleged perversions of Hollywood stars. During this year\u2019s cycle, endorsements were often countered online by Trump supporters arguing that the celebrity in question would have been present at parties hosted by Diddy, the rapper and record executive who is now in jail charged with sex trafficking and racketeering. By linking the two, and implying that liberal celebrities were in some way at least conscious of Diddy\u2019s alleged crimes, they serve to undermine the whole power of celebrity itself, rebranding it from something glitzy and desirable to the face of evil. But then conspiracy theories during elections are nothing new. \u201cThere will always be a segment of voters who mistrust celebrity and Hollywood and lean into conspiracy theories,\u201d says Abramovitch. Despite all this, nobody would be surprised to see politicians clambering for endorsements when the next election comes around. After all, there\u2019s nothing to say they actively harmed Harris\u2019s campaign \u2013 she may have done much worse without them. Even Maslon admits that \u201cto have the most famous black female singer in the world not endorse Harris probably would have been a big negative, just by implication\u201d. Ultimately, Maslon says, there is really only one celebrity endorsement that has been shown to make a huge difference in US elections \u2013 and that\u2019s when the candidate is already a celebrity. \u201cAnd so they endorse themselves!\u201d He cites George Murphy, the 1940s movie star who ran successfully to become the senator for California, paving the way for the likes of Ronald Reagan, Schwarzenegger and of course Trump. \u201cIt seems to happen a lot in the Republican party,\u201d he says. So if Swift or Beyonc\u00e9 really want their celebrity star power to have an effect on the polls, perhaps they\u2019ll have to ditch the endorsements and run for office themselves. Just not for the party they currently support.",

        "trailText": "NFL replaces \u2018End Racism\u2019 written into end zone with \u2018Choose Love\u2019 before Trump\u2019s arrival at Louisiana stadium",
        "bodyText": "Donald Trump is due to give himself a term report on his contentious first three weeks in office at tonight\u2019s Super Bowl while becoming the first sitting president to attend the NFL\u2019s title game between the Philadelphia Eagles and two-time defending championship winning Kansas City Chiefs. The US president was expected to arrive at the Caesars Superdome where the game will be held in New Orleans at 3.50pm, according to the White House, and appear on the field about 4pm when he will be joined by the House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the New Orleans Saints owner, Gayle Benson. Trump arrives in New Orleans as the NFL replaced \u201cEnd Racism\u201d with \u201cChoose Love\u201d written into the end zone. The inscription had been in place since the racial justice protests that followed the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a white police officer. Trump had campaigned against NFL players \u201ctaking the knee\u201d before kick-off in a symbolic gesture against racism, a practice that has been discontinued. Alvin Tillery, a politics professor and diversity expert at Northwestern University, told the Associated Press that the NFL\u2019s decision to remove \u201cEnd Racism\u201d slogans was \u201cshameful\u201d given that the league \u201cmakes tens of billions of dollars largely on the bodies of Black men\u201d. Tillery said the league should explain who it was aiming to please. In a statement before heading to New Orleans from his home in Florida, Trump said he was looking forward to joining fans for a sense of national unity and patriotism. \u201cThe coaches, players, and team staff on the field tonight represent the best of the best in professional football, but they also embody the best of the American dream,\u201d he said. Trump also noted the 14 deaths and 35 injuries from the truck attack in New Orleans on New Year\u2019s Day: \u201cWe remember that 14 families will be missing a loved one who was tragically murdered during a senseless terrorist attack while celebrating the New Year on Bourbon Street.\u201d A White House official said Trump would meet with family members of the attack who will be honorary coin toss participants just before the big game. Trump added that the game was an annual opportunity to transcend differences, saying that the Chiefs and Eagles\u2019 coaches, players and staff \u201crepresent the hopes and dreams of our Nation\u2019s young athletes as we restore safety and fairness in sports and equal opportunities among their teams\u201d. The Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce told reporters it was \u201cpretty cool\u201d that Trump would attend the game on Sunday, but it is not known how pop star Taylor Swift, also attending the game, may interpret her beau\u2019s endorsement. Trump battled Swift\u2019s perceived Democratic leanings throughout the 2024 presidential campaign. Two months before the vote, Swift said she planned to vote for Kamala Harris \u201cbecause she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them\u201d. Trump retorted with: \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\u201d in a post on his Truth Social platform.",

        "trailText": "When JD Vance dismissed Kamala Harris as a \u2018childless cat lady\u2019, it sparked controversy, brought Taylor Swift into the presidential debate and focused attention on right-wing political pressure placed on women to have children",
        "bodyText": "When writer and artist Alice Maddicott\u2019s beloved rescue cat died, she was understandably bereft. Dylan was a proper character, she says, the kind of gregarious cat that follows you to the pub or for a walk. But mourning him made Alice, who was then in her late 30s and single, feel faintly self-conscious. What if people thought she was a mad cat lady, weeping spinsterish tears for her pet? \u201cIf I\u2019d had a dog, there would be no stereotype. But as a single woman approaching 40, it could be seen very differently,\u201d says Maddicott. Curious about the origins of such a kneejerk prejudice, she started digging into its history. The research became a book, Cat Women, reclaiming an insult long used to belittle older women (especially non-compliant ones) or frighten younger women into settling down, lest they end up like the crazy cat lady from The Simpsons: once a high achiever, now a burnt-out drunk. But as Maddicott points out, it\u2019s an objectively ridiculous insult. There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201ccrazy cat man\u201d and single hamster owners aren\u2019t considered a threat to the patriarchal order. Only cat ladies touch a nerve, because only cat ladies immediately conjure up the idea of witches. In medieval times, the devil was believed to give cats as gifts to women inducted into witchcraft, Maddicott explains: so strong was the association that at the Bideford witch trials in 17th-century Devon, one woman was accused after a cat was seen slipping in through her window. \u201cProbably an eccentric older woman feeding a stray, but that was used to condemn her.\u201d Single women, unrestrained and also undefended by any man, made dangerously easy scapegoats if sickness came or the crops failed. Thankfully, people no longer believe in witches ruining lives out of spite. Or do they? Three years ago, the then aspiring Republican senator (and now vice-presidential candidate) JD Vance complained on Fox News that America was being run by \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\u201d He named vice-president Kamala Harris, secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg (who is gay) and the young New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as politicians who supposedly had no stake in the future they were legislating for. The idea that if you haven\u2019t given birth, you don\u2019t count, was hurtful to many doting stepmothers (as Harris is) or adoptive parents (like Buttigieg). But most incendiary of all was the idea that not having children renders a person a bitter, vengeful husk, desperate to drag everyone else down with them. Polling this summer, after those comments were dug up and recirculated, found two-thirds of Americans disagreed that not having biological children was a hindrance in a president; even among Republicans, only 15% agreed. Though Vance now insists he was merely being sarcastic, for many women on both sides of the Atlantic, those words summed up a strand of politics that seemingly values them mainly for their ability to procreate and views their right to choose with suspicion. Though powerful women have long been shamed for not being mothers \u2013 \u201cdeliberately barren\u201d, the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard\u2019s opponents called her \u2013 in the current climate, attacks on childless cat ladies have a sharper edge. In both the US and Europe, rightwing parties are weaponising female fertility as a political issue, tapping into a potent mix of misogyny, economic anxiety and overtly racist angst about being \u201creplaced\u201d as the dominant culture if white women don\u2019t start breeding more enthusiastically. Though falling birth rates across the developed world are an undeniable economic headache \u2013 shrinking populations mean fewer young workers to fund pensions for the old and, typically, lower growth \u2013 populists focus on the way a dwindling workforce leads to more imported labour. Hungary\u2019s populist leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n has claimed the west is \u201ccommitting suicide\u201d by not making babies; in Germany, the far right AfD called in its manifesto for \u201clarger families instead of mass immigration\u201d. Elon Musk, the X owner and Donald Trump donor, tweets in apocalyptic terms about impending \u201cpopulation collapse\u201d. Yet still, the baby drought persists. Around one in five British women don\u2019t have children by the end of their fertile years \u2013 the Office for National Statistics doesn\u2019t keep equivalent statistics for men \u2013 and this year deaths overtook births for the first time (outside a pandemic) since the 1970s. Almost half of Americans under 50, meanwhile, are childless. Or should that be childfree? For this year of shaming women has also been a year of women refusing to be shamed: older women reclaiming witchy insults like \u201chag\u201d and \u201ccrone\u201d, while younger ones resist what they see as a Handmaid\u2019s Tale future of curtailed rights over their own bodies. Like the cat-eared pink hats that anti-Trump marchers wore in 2017, referencing his boasts about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d, in 2024 a \u201cChildless Cat Lady for Kamala\u201d T-shirt or sticker is now a gleeful statement of defiance. When Taylor Swift identified as one in her Instagram post formally endorsing Harris, it felt like something of a Spartacus moment \u2013 arguably even more so when Elon Musk responded with a creepy tweet offering to get her pregnant. What\u2019s different about Swift isn\u2019t merely that she, too, is unmarried, childfree and a cat owner at 34; it\u2019s that she makes it look like a blast. Rich, powerful and taking her pick of trophy boyfriends, she lives closer to what would once have been called a rakish bachelor\u2019s life than a spinster\u2019s \u2013 though these days spinsterdom is a story told very differently. In Kate Winslet\u2019s recent feminist biopic Lee, about the pioneering Second World War photographer Lee Miller, there is a scene in which Winslet\u2019s Miller and Vogue magazine editor Audrey Withers ask each other if they\u2019re planning to have children. \u201cGod no,\u201d says Withers, cheerfully. \u201cOh God no,\u201d echoes Winslet\u2019s Miller. It\u2019s a bonding moment in the film which implies neither could have done what they did \u2013 in Miller\u2019s case following the US army\u2019s advance across Europe and documenting newly liberated concentration camps; and in Withers\u2019s case battling the censors to publish her images \u2013 if they\u2019d had families at home. Though Miller did eventually have a son after the war, the film doesn\u2019t duck the fact their relationship was difficult and ultimately lets her work take centre stage. It\u2019s how great men\u2019s stories are often told, drawing a veil over domestic shortcomings, but more rarely women\u2019s. Once upon a time in Hollywood, childless women could be mad, murderous bunny boilers \u2013 in films like Single White Female and Fatal Attraction \u2013 or at a push Bridget Jones, terrified of dying \u201cfat and alone\u201d. Now they can be Carrie Bradshaw, reimagined in And Just Like That\u2026 as a sexy fiftysomething widow with a fluffy rescue cat, or even Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, the eternally childless doll who (according to her creator Ruth Handler) \u201calways represented the fact that a woman has choices\u201d. Though the film has a darker side, with the Kens\u2019 angry revolt against the Barbie matriarchy echoing a backlash many young women say they\u2019re experiencing in real life, the Barbieland both sides seek to control is a hedonistic land of parties and beach days where nobody is spending their Saturdays bleary-eyed at soft play. The toymaker Mattel has always resisted pleas to give Barbie and Ken children; instead they stayed forever aspirational Dinks, an 80s acronym for Dual Income No Kids now gleefully revived by millennials. \u201cWe\u2019re DINKs. Of course we are already planning our European vacation next year,\u201d says TikToker @johnefinance, in a chirpy post last December that racked up over 290,000 likes. \u201cWe\u2019re DINKs; we spend our discretionary income on $8 lattes,\u201d his partner giggles. Social media is still awash with #dinkcouple posts bragging about how much more money, sex and sleep they get compared to haggard new parents, recasting childless life as the opposite of sad and empty. Unusually, the trend brings young men\u2019s perspectives into a debate normally (and exhaustingly) focused on women. But it also reflects polling released by the Pew Center thinktank earlier this year showing the most common reason childless Americans under 50 give for not being parents is that they just don\u2019t want to. TikTok\u2019s Dinks are young, and maybe not ruling parenthood out forever. But for now their lives arguably look a lot more fun than being a tradwife, those sourdough-baking, God-fearing, home-schooling mothers of multiple children whose retro social media content is \u2013 depending on your view \u2013 either a bit of guilty escapist fantasy for tired working women or a sinister attempt to drag women back into the kitchen. This summer a British newspaper interview with uber-tradwife Hannah Neeleman (aka @ballerinafarm), in which the writer wondered how exactly she\u2019d ended up sacrificing a ballet career to have eight children and why her husband kept answering questions for her, triggered days of debate about whether she was being secretly oppressed or whether (as Neeleman\u2019s fans argued) this was a hit piece by a writer who doesn\u2019t have kids. Cut through all the noise, however, and there is one clear signal: neither the tradwife nor the Dink camp seem to think having it all is an option any more. You can\u2019t have kids and a career in ballet; you can\u2019t have a thrilling social life and children. You have to choose, with the implication that either way, something is lost. If there is a sadness to Neeleman talking about giving up on her professional ambitions, there is a faint whiff of financial distress around some of those Dink reels, too; a sense they\u2019re blowing their cash on bucket-list travel destinations because the idea of buying a family home (while paying nursery bills that cost more than a mortgage) seems wildly out of reach. The second most common reason childless Britons aged 35-44 gave for not having children (after thinking they were too old) was a split between \u201cI don\u2019t want the impact on my lifestyle\u201d and \u201cthe cost is too high\u201d, according to YouGov. But for those on tight budgets, the two are related. It may be no accident that Britain\u2019s last mini-baby boom was in the early Noughties \u2013 fuelled by cheaper childcare, longer maternity leave and rising prosperity \u2013 or that it fizzled out with the 2009 recession. On both sides of the Atlantic, women who do want kids some day are tired of being blamed for their childlessness by politicians who seemingly won\u2019t meet them halfway: who instead of building cheap houses for first-time buyers or slashing their nursery bills, suggest (in Vance\u2019s case) that grandparents could help out for free. But for some women, there\u2019s an added worry that politicians cajoling or shaming women into having children may eventually turn to forcing them. For American women under 30, abortion is now the number one election issue, according to an October poll by the health policy researchers KFF. Two years ago, the overturning of Roe v Wade \u2013 the landmark ruling underpinning legal abortion in America \u2013 left the way open for an all-out assault on reproductive rights. At campaign rally after rally, Harris has hammered away at fears of what a Republican administration might do. She often quotes Project 2025, the infamous leaked wishlist for a second Trump term drawn up by a rightwing thinktank, which argues for giving foetuses legal rights and scrapping funding for contraceptive services. In Europe, too, rightwing governments in Hungary, Italy and Poland have tightened abortion law, though furious female voters helped propel a pro-liberalisation Polish government into power last year. For now, Britain seems to be on a much more progressive path. The prospect of curbs on abortion in this parliament looks at first glance remote, though the Labour MP Stella Creasy \u2013 who has been aggressively targeted in her constituency by anti-abortion activists \u2013 argues complacency is dangerous. \u201cIf the election hadn\u2019t been called, it\u2019s not clear that we wouldn\u2019t have seen the first rollback on rights in 50 years,\u201d she says, pointing to a backbench attempt to reduce the legal time limit from 24 to 22 weeks in the dying months of the last Conservative government. But the Tory MP Miriam Cates \u2013 who once argued that dwindling fertility rates are \u201cthe one overarching threat\u201d to western society \u2013 lost her seat in July, while the Tory leadership favourite Kemi Badenoch says she isn\u2019t convinced governments can make women have babies. America\u2019s fate, however, still hangs by a thread, with a stark divide emerging particularly among the young: women for Harris, angry young men for Trump. Whether she wins or whether she loses in the coming election, it almost certainly won\u2019t be because (along with every other occupant of the Oval Office in history) Kamala Harris hasn\u2019t physically given birth. Most Americans say this election is still about the economy, stupid. But what is clear from months of arguing about childless cat ladies is that being one is just another American story now. When the pollsters Ipsos went looking this summer for female voters with no kids at home, but with a feline companion, the surprise was all the ways in which they were pretty much like everyone else: mostly suburban, disproportionately white, mostly with some college education, no richer or poorer than average \u2013 and in almost a third of cases, Republicans. They\u2019re living behind the same white-picket fences as everyone else, shopping at Target, working nine to five, just getting on with life. And the clearer that becomes, the harder it is to pretend that every childless cat lady is a witch. Feline friendship Cat lover and author Britt Collins on her furry companions I never imagined that childless cat ladies would become a political force and a whole new demographic. Over the years, I\u2019ve heard all the snarks: mad, lonely, obsessive \u2013 the old witch-hunting slurs that have dogged outlier women forever. Am I miserable by the choices I made? Hell, no. Here\u2019s the thing, cats rock and I don\u2019t have to defend my choices. If I wanted kids, I\u2019d have adopted one. The only time I felt lonely was in the last year of my marriage when I lost my sense of self. I\u2019ve had boyfriends since I was 15, always cat men, and I still adore my two long-term exes with whom I spent my 20s and 30s. I\u2019ve raised dozens of strays with them and had the best of times. However, these days, my ideal man is a gay vet. I\u2019m happy with my mogs, enjoying the deep, uncomplicated love and pure joy of feline friendship. Still, I\u2019ve had strangers tell me that giving up on relationships, as I moved into my 50s, is no way to live. Women and the cats they love have long been maligned, somehow seen as lesser-than or unfulfilled. Carving out my own little universe, I\u2019ve filled it with cats and creativity. I\u2019ve travelled to more than 35 countries, looked after big cats, baboons, bats and various wild orphans, written two books, ghostwritten and edited others, edited and created magazines, run a sell-out cat festival, directed pop videos and completed the screenplay adaption for my book, Strays, that has sparked interest from Hollywood producers. I do what I want, when I want \u2013 enjoying the privileges historically afforded to men. Journalist and activist Gloria Steinem, who\u2019s had many felines over the decades, credits them as her teachers \u2018when it comes to a strong will and self-authority\u2019. When Steinem was asked how to raise the next generation of feminists, she said: \u2018Like cats. They tell you what they\u2019re going to do, and that\u2019s that.\u2019 Cats, with their punky attitudes, have taught me defiance and everything else worth knowing. They are sensualists, things of beauty, who\u2019ve inspired artists for centuries. Lennon, McCartney, Bowie, Dylan and many of the greatest rock stars were all crazy-cat ladies. Us cat people of all political stripes may not agree on everything, but we don\u2019t let it get in the way of what matters most.

This Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles, we once again bear witness to a perfect American marriage: the country\u2019s biggest sporting event coupled with a live music gig so valuable to its megastar performers that they undertake it for free. It is a coupling that the rest of the world has typically looked on with a quizzical smile, a tolerant shake of the head, a murmur that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t work for them\u201d. After all, this is a cultural touchpoint so uniquely American that hundreds of thousands of people tune in to it just to watch the adverts. To a Brit, it can seem unfathomable. Some of us still remember Atomic Kitten\u2019s blank reception at cricket\u2019s first ever Twenty20 finals day in 2003. When the pop trio took to the stage between the semis and the final, the bafflement in the stands was so tangible that they found themselves singing to a tiny handful of interested parties. \u201cThis is our last song,\u201d Liz McClarnon eventually told an otherwise unbothered Trent Bridge crowd. \u201cThen you can all get back to your cricket.\u201d Who needed chart-toppers, when we had Jimmy Ormond rattling out Warwickshire\u2019s top order? But times have changed, and the goalposts are moving: quite literally, with sports stadiums developing into multiuse grounds. \u201cImagine Dragons play Spurs\u201d is a two-night stop on a world tour, not a thought experiment, and technological improvements in groundskeeping have allowed arena shows to bed down quite cosily within a busy fixtures calendar, from Arctic Monkeys at Old Trafford to Neil Diamond at the Rose Bowl. Sports organisers, meanwhile, are programming ever more live musical accompaniment to the games themselves, hoping to broaden its audience base, or to get fans into the stadium earlier and spending more on food and drink. The FA Cup final includes DJ sets in its buildup. The Hundred partnered with the BBC\u2019s \u201cIntroducing\u201d series to platform emerging artists. The Champions League final has incorporated a pre-game show into its opening ceremonies, from Alicia Keys in Milan to the Black Eyed Peas in Cardiff. Soccer \u2013 like most sports \u2013 looks on admiringly at the unique engagement the Super Bowl attracts (last year\u2019s event was the most-watched TV programme in US history, with 123.4 million viewers) and the ad spend it commands ($8m for a single 30-second advert). In September, Fifa announced that the 2026 World Cup final, to be held at New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium, will be the first ever to feature a half-time show. After all, if you\u2019re going to try it anywhere, it makes sense to make the attempt in a country that actually appreciates them. The US didn\u2019t invent the idea of musical interludes at sporting events: their Super Bowl tradition can be traced directly to British shores. As weekend games became mass entertainment in the late 19th century, football and cricket clubs hired brass bands to keep the crowds happy during the break. The nascent American sports adopted the practice too, where it found its way into college sport and became a central part of its boosterish culture. Marching bands were the interval attraction at the Super Bowl\u2019s inaugural edition in 1967. By the early 70s, the half-time shows incorporated stars such as Ella Fitzgerald and Andy Williams, and in the 1990s the NFL began promoting them as an event in their own right, harnessing Michael Jackson\u2019s planetary pull to stop casual viewers turning off at the end of the second quarter. By the 2000s, they had become the ultimate watercooler event (see: Nipplegate), a must-watch that\u2019s worth millions of dollars in sales, streams and brand value to the featured artist. And the UK? Well, we just kept marching our military bands across the Lord\u2019s outfield, and singing in the rain with Cliff Richard at Wimbledon. It\u2019s not that we weren\u2019t offered something different. Sky Sports\u2019s pioneering Monday Night Football broadcast in 1992 included the Shamen performing their No 1 hit Ebeneezer Goode, to a half-time Highbury crowd whose team were 1-0 up against Manchester City. Unfortunately the band were accompanied by a dance troupe dressed in Tottenham colours, and soon found themselves booed off the pitch. Football fans\u2019 scornful attitude towards interval entertainment isn\u2019t mere snobbery, it\u2019s also born of practical considerations. Half-time is a precious window to get to the bar, or buy your kids chips, or join the long line for the loos. But the sports industry\u2019s attention is increasingly on the casual consumer, not the hardcore fan who just wants to get on with the game. For Fifa, the half-time show is an idea whose time has come. It has even wrapped the project in good-deed vibes: Global Citizen, a social justice advocacy organisation, will produce the gig, with Hugh Jackman, a bona fide great guy, as is its ambassador. Equally great guy Gianni Infantino announced that the partnership will \u201cbring together the worlds of sport and entertainment to actively contribute to a better world\u201d. What this means remains undetailed. Does Fifa plan to help world poverty by committing all the ad revenue it receives to feeding the hungry? Or will David Beckham finally broker a Spice Girls\u2019 30-year reunion? Taylor and Travis take note \u2013 with a great sports-pop relationship comes great responsibility. \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 is out in front with the nominations for the 67th Grammy awards in what promises to be another female-heavy year. The star has scored 11 nods for her country album Cowboy Carter with recognition in the country, pop and Americana categories. It\u2019s the biggest number of nominations she has received in a single year and she now holds the joint record of most-nominated artist ever alongside her husband, Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 is also the most awarded artist in Grammys history with 32 wins, yet has not won album of the year to date. In that category she faces competition from Andr\u00e9 3000, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Jacob Collier, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift. Following Beyonc\u00e9 with seven nominations each are Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish. Then with six each is Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. Breakout star Roan continues a highly successful year and will be one of the favourites in the new artist category alongside Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, Khruangbin, Raye, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims. The record of the year category contains The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2018Em, Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso, Charli xcx \u2013 360, Kendrick Lemar \u2013 Not Like Us, Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck Babe and Taylor Swift and Post Malone \u2013 Fortnight. The song of the year category includes Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy), Billie Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019s Die with a Smile, Taylor Swift and Post Malone\u2019s Fortnight, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck Babe, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Please Please Please and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2018Em. The dance categories also saw recognition for Justice, Troye Sivan and Disclosure while the rock categories were led by The Black Keys and Green Day. The controversial star Chris Brown, who was the subject of a new documentary detailing various allegations of abuse and sexual assault, was featured prominently in the R&amp;B categories alongside Muni Long and Lucky Daye. Lamar was the most-nominated rap artist and faces competition in those categories from Eminem and J Cole. Dolly Parton, Jimmy Carter and Barbra Streisand also feature in the unusual line-up for this year\u2019s audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais are featured in the comedy album line-up. The recording academy\u2019s CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, called music a \u201cpowerful force for good\u201d in his introduction to today\u2019s announcement. The awards are voted on by a body of 13,000 members. No new categories were added for the first time in four years. Earlier this year, Taylor Swift became the first artist to win album of the year for the fourth time, taking home the award for Midnights. The 67th Grammy awards will take place on 2 February 2025 with a host for the ceremony yet to be announced.",

        "trailText": "Can the Chiefs pull off a three-peat? Who is the halftime performer? Will Trump\u2019s NFL appearance be met with applause? We (mostly) have the answers",
        "bodyText": "The biggest game of the year in US sports takes place on Sunday. We\u2019re here to answer all your questions (or the ones we came up with anyway). Let\u2019s get the simple stuff out the way first. Who is playing in the Super Bowl? This year\u2019s Super Bowl \u2013 or Super Bowl LIX for NFL brand evangelists and fans of Roman numerals \u2013 will be between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. You may be familiar with the Chiefs\u2019 body of work: this is their fifth Super Bowl appearance in six seasons, and a victory would be their third championship in a row, something no NFL team has achieved before. In short, they\u2019re really good. The Eagles, meanwhile, are in their third Super Bowl in seven seasons, thanks in large part to the genius-level intellect of their general manager, Howie Roseman. In short, they\u2019re also really good. When will the Chiefs and Eagles kickoff? The game starts on Sunday 9 February at 5.30pm local time in New Orleans, which is 6.30pm on the US east coast, 3.30pm on the west coast, 11.30pm in the UK and 10.30am on Monday in Sydney. And where can I watch or stream it? Unsurprisingly, the game is sold out but tickets are on resale for as, ahem, little as $2,800. A slightly cheaper option is watching it on TV. Fox is this year\u2019s broadcaster in the US, with the main analyst being Tom Brady, who won seven Super Bowls himself during his playing career. Spanish language viewers have two options: Fox Deportes and Telemundo. In Canada, the game is on TSN and CTV; in Britain you can watch on ITV1 and Sky Sports; and in Australia you can catch it on the Seven Network and ESPN. Where will it be played? The Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints, will host the game. The NFL tends to choose warm weather cities as hosts to avoid fans freezing during the game. But northern cities do occasionally get the Super Bowl \u2013 the distinctly untropical Minneapolis was given the nod in 2018 \u2013 but in those cases they\u2019re nearly always played in indoor stadiums. Do teams ever play the Super Bowl in their own stadium? Host cities are chosen years in advance, so while teams can end up playing in their own stadium, it\u2019s rare. Only two teams, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams, have won the Super Bowl in their own stadium. Right now, the Saints are what NFL experts refer to as a Very Bad Team \u2013 they did not make the playoffs this season. Which celebrities will be at the game? Just in case you\u2019re one of the eight people on the planet who don\u2019t know this, Chiefs star Travis Kelce is Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriend. She\u2019ll almost certainly be at the game, and the cameras will cut to her every 39 seconds or so. Last year, some on the US right believed the game would be fixed to ensure a Chiefs/Kelce/Swift victory in order to give Joe Biden an advantage in the presidential election. The conspiracy did not quite work out as planned. In other good-looking people news, Bradley Cooper is a hardcore Eagles fan and is more than likely to be at the game. Paul Rudd, a longtime Chiefs fan, was at last year\u2019s game and is likely to attend this year too. But there are a lot of complimentary tickets to the Super Bowl, so expect plenty more celebs. So the game will unite a divided America? Yeah \u2026 sure. Donald Trump is set to become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. And because we haven\u2019t heard enough from him of late, he\u2019ll sit down for a no doubt measured and conciliatory interview that will be broadcast before the game on Fox. What kind of reception will Trump get? Trump is a big sports fan. He has been cheered at college football games but was booed and greeted with chants of \u201clock him up\u201d when he appeared at the 2019 World Series in his first term as president. The Super Bowl will be played in a Democratic city in a Republican state in front of fans from all over America, so the most likely reaction is cheers and boos when he appears on screen. Somewhat surprisingly, given that Trump once wrote \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT\u201d on social media, Kelce says it will be an honor to play in front of the president. Will this affect the rumored proposal Kelce has prepared for Swift after the game? It may! Although Kelce pushed back on those rumors earlier in the week when he was asked if he intended to give Swift a ring after the game. \u201cA Super Bowl ring? Next question,\u201d he said. Who are the players to watch? The Chiefs have the best player on the planet, Patrick Mahomes, at quarterback. A win on Sunday would be his fourth Super Bowl title, putting him on track to break Brady\u2019s record of seven and threaten the former Patriots star as the greatest quarterback of all time. Mahomes does not roll out as many breathtaking throws as he once did, but the 29-year-old nearly always makes the right decision and is best when the pressure is on, which is pretty useful in the biggest game of the season. The Chiefs also have a brilliant defense, masterminded by defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. The Eagles are led by running back Saquon Barkley, who joined them from their rivals, the New York Giants in the offseason, and promptly had one of the best rushing seasons of all time. The Eagles also have a formidable defense and arguably the deepest and best roster in the entire NFL. Who is doing the half-time show? Bad news for Drake if he wants to watch: Kendrick Lamar will be performing at half-time (he also appeared at the 2022 Super Bowl). Louisiana native Jon Batiste will sing the national anthem. Who is the favorite to win the Super Bowl? The Chiefs are the betting favorites, which is not a huge surprise considering they\u2019re the two-time reigning champs, have been to seven straight AFC Championships, won nine straight AFC west division titles and have lost just twice all season. But they also won a lot of tight games they could easily have lost, although some point out the fact that they do so with monotonous regularity shows they\u2019re good rather than lucky. The Eagles also have a deeper roster, which gives them the edge for many pundits. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2025 to remove a suggestion that Taylor Swift endorsed Joe Biden in 2024. She endorsed Kamala Harris on 10 September 2024.",

        "bodyText": "Charli xcx leads this year\u2019s Brit awards with five nominations for her 2024-dominating record Brat \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s album of last year. With four nominations apiece, Dua Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith are close on the pop star\u2019s trail. xcx is nominated for album, artist and song of the year \u2013 the latter for the remix of Guess featuring Billie Eilish \u2013 and in the dance and pop genre categories. But despite xcx painting the British music industry\u2019s annual party a violent shade of lime green, women remain underrepresented in this year\u2019s nominations, accounting for 34.7% of the 98 slots. Male acts comprise more than half, at 53%, with mixed-gender acts and collaborations \u2013 including the Last Dinner Party \u2013 making up the remaining 12.3%. It\u2019s a noteworthy year for some vintage groups: the Beatles\u2019 AI-abetted Now and Then is up for best song, the group\u2019s first nomination since the very first Brit awards in 1977. (Prior to becoming an annual fixture in 1983, the first Brits marked Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s silver jubilee and 100 years since the invention of the phonograph, and honoured the preceding 25 years in music, seeing the Beatles earn three nominations.) And with three nominations for Songs of a Lost World \u2013 their first album since 2008 \u2013 the Cure score their first Brit nominations in more than 30 years in the categories for album of the year, group of the year and alt/rock act. At the newer end of the scale, Stargazing singer Smith is this year\u2019s Rising Star winner, tipped by the industry for major success, and is also nominated for new artist, song and pop act. The genre categories are assembled by the Brits voting academy and then voted for by members of the public via WhatsApp. Predictably, the category for hip-hop/grime/rap act features just one woman, Little Simz, alongside Central Cee, Dave, Ghetts and Stormzy. London jazz act Ezra Collective may also be set for a breakthrough year. The five-piece released their third album, Dance, No One\u2019s Watching, in September, after winning the 2023 Mercury prize for their second album. \u201cFrom a youth club to the Brit awards and beyond,\u201d they said in a statement. Some may raise eyebrows at a group active since 2016 being up for new artist \u2013 alongside last year\u2019s Mercury winners English Teacher, the Last Dinner Party, Myles Smith and former Brit School student Rachel Chinouriri \u2013 but the category parameters stipulate that acts must have had one Top 40 album or single in the eligibility period, but can\u2019t have had a Top 10 album or more than one Top 10 single, nor have had prior nominations for best artist, group or album. Despite middling reviews for her third album Radical Optimism \u2013 which spent just 19 weeks in the UK Top 100, compared to 220 for her 2020 record Future Nostalgia \u2013 Lipa is nominated for album of the year, artist of the year, song of the year (for Training Season) and pop act. Last year\u2019s major winner, Raye \u2013 who took home six prizes in 2024 \u2013 is up for R&amp;B act. \u201cI\u2019m still processing the ridiculousness that was last year!\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to watch Charli xcx clean up this year, she just deserves it so much.\u201d Some nascent comebacks also feature: Sam Fender is up for artist of the year and alt/rock act, despite only having released two singles from his forthcoming third album, People Watching, due in February; and Jade, of the on-hiatus band Little Mix, is up for song of the year (for Angel of My Dreams) and pop act. In the international categories, Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish have two nods apiece; Eilish also clocks a third nomination alongside xcx in the song category. \u201cThank you so much for the nominations and the recognition of my art,\u201d Roan said in a statement. \u201cThe UK has always shown me so much love and championed me through these past few years. It was one of the first places that Good Luck, Babe! blew up in, so this feels extra special.\u201d The awards for producer and songwriter of the year will be announced prior to the ceremony, which takes place on 1 March at the O2 Arena in London.

        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",

        "headline": "What time are the NFL Christmas games and when does Beyonc\u00e9 perform?",
        "trailText": "What time does it start? Why Netflix? And when does Beyonc\u00e9 go on? We (mostly) have the answers",
        "bodyText": "The NFL Christmas games are taking place on, you guessed it, Christmas. And if you\u2019re anything like millions of people around the world then you\u2019re probably wondering: what time does the Beyonc\u00e9 show begin? But is that all you really need to know? What about the sporty bits? The odds of a Taylor Swift sighting? And how long you\u2019ll have to stream it on Netflix before it disappears? Read on for all the answers \u2026 What time is kickoff for Chiefs v Steelers? The kickoff time for the Kansas City v Pittsburgh game at Acrisure Stadium is 1pm ET (6pm GMT). But you\u2019ll want to get to the couch about 10 minutes early if you\u2019re interested in seeing Mariah Carey perform a special pre-taped version of her 16-time platinum single All I Want for Christmas Is You. Will Taylor Swift be there? The tabs are reporting Taylor and All-Pro boyfriend Travis Kelce will be spending the holiday together with both of their families. So it\u2019s a safe bet she\u2019ll be at the stadium on Wednesday, possibly alongside field hockey coach and Rogan-toppling podcaster Kylie Kelce. What time is kickoff for Ravens v Texans? The kickoff time for the Baltimore v Houston matchup at NRG Stadium is 4.30pm ET (9.30pm GMT). And the streets are saying an all-conquering pop star might be at that game as well. How can I watch or stream the NFL Christmas Day games? The broadcast will stream live globally on Netflix starting with a pre-game show at 11am ET (4pm GMT) at no additional cost to subscribers. Additionally, the games will be carried on free-to-air CBS in the competing teams\u2019 cities and on US mobile devices with NFL+. How much did Netflix pay for NFL Christmas games? And why are they getting into live sports? Netflix has signed a three-year agreement with the NFL to exclusively stream Christmas Day games from 2024 through 2026. The streamer is paying approximately $75m per game in the first year. CBS Sports has been tapped to produce the broadcasts on a one-year contract. What does Netflix get for their $150m? For starters, in a media landscape where TV ratings are falling off across the board, live sports continue to buck the trend. That\u2019s caught the attention of media and tech giants like Amazon (who bought into the NFL) and Apple (who bought Messi), amid several other billion-dollar bets on sports programming as a driver for subscriptions. In addition to the NFL games, Netflix has engaged in other live sports ventures, including last month\u2019s boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, a 10-year broadcasting deal with WWE valued at $5bn, The Netflix Cup (a golf pro-am with F1 drivers) and The Netflix Slam (a tennis exhibition between Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal in Las Vegas). Can a streamer handle live sports? Netflix\u2019s ability to handle live NFL Christmas games will be a major test of its streaming infrastructure. While the platform has a strong record in on-demand streaming and some experience with live events like Chris Rock: Selective Outrage, the NFL games bring unique challenges, including massive simultaneous viewership and real-time delivery. The Christmas Day games are expected to draw many millions of viewers, pushing Netflix\u2019s scalability and reliability to the limit. Any buffering, lags or outages, such as what happened during the Paul v Tyson stream, could harm its reputation. How many people watched last year\u2019s NFL Christmas games? The 2023 NFL Christmas Day tripleheader drew an average of 28.7m viewers across three games, a 29% increase from the previous year\u2019s 22.2m average. The Raiders v Chiefs game at 1pm on CBS and Nickelodeon attracted 29.6m viewers, making it the second most-watched NFL Christmas game on record. The Giants v Eagles game at 4.30pm on FOX followed with 29.0m viewers, while the primetime Ravens v 49ers game at 8.15pm ET on ABC and ESPN+ drew 27.6m viewers. Each game ranked among the top five most-watched NFL Christmas Day games since 1988, showcasing the league\u2019s growing ability to capture holiday audiences. When does the Beyonc\u00e9 halftime show start? And what game is it in the middle of? Beyonc\u00e9 is scheduled to perform during half-time of second game between the Ravens and Texans. The show is expected to start approximately 90 minutes after kickoff, so around 6pm ET. Why Beyonc\u00e9? Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s half-time gig is a strategic collaboration that highlights her ties to her Houston hometown, leveraging her star power to enhance the event\u2019s pan-cultural appeal. This aligns with the NFL\u2019s goal of blending sports and entertainment to maximize holiday viewership. Of course Beyonc\u00e9 is no stranger to the NFL\u2019s grand stage. In 2013, she delivered a show-stopping halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, where she was joined by Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams for a memorable Destiny\u2019s Child reunion. Three years later, at Super Bowl 50, Beyonc\u00e9 returned to the field alongside Coldplay and Bruno Mars, captivating an audience of 115.5m households. Only true Beyhivers will remember her first NFL performance: with Destiny\u2019s Child at half-time of a 1998 preseason game between the Giants and Jets at the Meadowlands when she was 16. What is she expected to perform? The show will serve as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first live showcase of songs from her album Cowboy Carter. Details have been scarce, but the oddsmakers have priced joint-lead single Texas Hold \u2018Em as a heavy favorite to open her set. The prospect of special guests has been teased, so don\u2019t be surprised if Shaboozey or Dolly Parton makes a cameo. How can I watch the Beyonc\u00e9 replay? You don\u2019t have to watch Beyonc\u00e9 (or the football) as it happens, but plan accordingly. In the United States, the Christmas Day broadcast will disappear from the platform three hours after the livestream ends. Outside in the US, it will expires 24 hours after the livestream ends.",

        "trailText": "With nominations led by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx, the event will serve a dual-purpose by acknowledging the devastating wildfires in California",
        "bodyText": "A \u201cvery different\u201d Grammy awards will take place in Los Angeles this weekend, impacted by the recent wildfires that have affected California. The annual celebration of music, taking place at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday, will still feature a range of big-name performers but there will be a noticeable shift in purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical Grammy party atmosphere,\u201d said Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the Recording Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only \u2018the show must go on\u2019 but the show must provide a greater service. Of course, we\u2019re going to honor music, but our goal is to utilise music to make a difference.\u201d The week leading to the Grammys typically sees a string of major parties put on by record labels, but the majority have been cancelled in response to the fires, which have killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of structures. Money will instead be diverted to those in need. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\u201d Mason said. \u201cIt will honour some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d The annual tradition that will go ahead in Clive Davis\u2019s legendary gala, which takes place the night before. This year\u2019s event will also include a fundraising element. \u201cWe want to ensure that the evening will not only be a memorable night of music but will also provide impactful support for those very much in need,\u201d Davis said. This year\u2019s nominees are led by Beyonc\u00e9, whose country album Cowboy Carter brought her 11 nods, making her the most nominated artist ever alongside husband Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to win the award for album of the year and if she wins this weekend, she would be only the fourth Black woman to take it home. The star has been nominated for the award four times before. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d Jay-Z said last year on stage. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has already become the first solo Black female to top the country charts in the US and could make history if she wins in the country categories on Sunday. The singer, whose mother Tina Knowles lost a home in the fires, has donated $2.5m to relief efforts. In the category of album of the year, she faces competition from stars including Andr\u00e9 3000, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx and Taylor Swift, who won last year. Swift, who has now won 14 Grammys, has also donated to a number of wildfire funds. In an Instagram statement, urging others to also contribute, she wrote that it was \u201cheartbreaking to see the stories unfold\u201d. The singer has been confirmed to present an award on Sunday. The evening will be hosted by Trevor Noah and feature performances from multiple nominees Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter with a special tribute to the late Quincy Jones, featuring Stevie Wonder and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. \u201cIt\u2019s Grammy week,\u201d Roan wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \u201cI am very emo. My heart feels warm and fuzzy with all the support I have been given this past year. I hope you can understand that this has been incredible and scary and spiritual and confusing.\u201d The evening lands in the middle of an awards season that has seen delays and shifts as a result of the ongoing wildfires. The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and a tweaked ceremony will remove original song performances and spend more time trying to \u201cacknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires\u201d. The Critics Choice awards were also delayed until 7 February. This week also saw a benefit concert in Los Angeles with stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Joni Mitchell performing.",

        "trailText": "While the US election topped our Googling this year, Raygun and the CrowdStrike outage were also high on the trends list",
        "bodyText": "Australians may not get a vote in the US presidential election but it topped the Google searches in the country in 2024, with Raygun, Julian Assange and the CrowdStrike outage being some of the key people and moments Australians wanted to know more about in the year. The election that will return Donald Trump to the White House was the No 1 overall Google search by Australians in 2024, according to the annual search results list released by the tech giant on Tuesday. US election information also topped the questions asked of Google, with Australians wanting to know when the US election was held and who won. The Olympics and the introduction to the world of the unique style of the breakdancer Raygun saw both keenly searched, with the Olympics taking five of the top 10 sport searches and the Paralympics taking two spots in the top 10. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The death of One Direction band member Liam Payne put his name in fourth place in overall searches, with Taylor Swift in the fifth spot , as well as being the most searched public figure in the world. Trump, who posted on Truth Social after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris that he hated the superstar, came in second. Harris came in fourth. Related to the Swiftmania, Ticketek Marketplace \u2013 where people could buy second-hand tickets \u2013 was ninth place in overall searches. Australians were following the news of the alleged murder of a Victorian woman, Samantha Murphy, which was in third place in news events. The Bondi Junction stabbing attack was also highly searched, and the advertising entrepreneur John Singleton was the most searched Australian figure in 2024, after his daughter was killed in the attack. The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who in June returned to Australia after nearly 14 years in prison when he agreed to a plea deal with the United States, was the second-most searched Australian public figure in 2024. The global outage of Windows computers in July led to the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike becoming a household name as it was found to be the cause (in fifth place in news events). Australians were also being very mindful, with \u201cdemure\u201d topping the list of word definition searches in response to a viral meme on TikTok by the creator Jools Lebron. Aside from Payne, the deaths of Dame Maggie Smith, Jesse Baird, Shannen Doherty, Donald Sutherland and James Earl Jones were among the top searched. Australians wanted to know how to watch sporting events more than anything else but were also interested in car repair, DIY Halloween costumes and \u201chow to talk to women\u201d. In the year when artificial intelligence seemed to become embedded in everything, how to switch off Meta\u2019s AI was also on the list. The New York Times\u2019 Connections puzzle topped entertainment searches, with Saltburn, the Netflix series Baby Reindeer and the Australian favourite Boy Swallows Universe also on the list. When it came to travel, Victorians seemed most keen to escape winter, with the top search for domestic travel being cheap flights from Melbourne to the Gold Coast, and two of the top 10 international travel searches being flights to Italy and Bangkok from Melbourne.",

        "trailText": "After dodging toxic fans, \u2018nepo baby\u2019 jibes and her own projectile vomit, the 25-year-old has just spent eight weeks at UK No 1. She explains why she\u2019s now writing about our dark, uncertain future",
        "bodyText": "On a video call from a hotel room in Hamburg, Gracie Abrams is expounding on the virtues of decoupling yourself from social media and living a life offline. \u201cYou can literally do so much when you\u2019re not scrolling!\u201d she enthuses. \u201cYou can retain more information; everything gets lighter. You have a greater capacity to be more present, to be there for the people in your life, to read a book that\u2019s going to inspire your next album, or go on a hike and breathe air instead of sitting in a dark room on fucking Instagram. I\u2019m doing lots of, like, tactile stuff, staying off social media,\u201d she adds. \u201cNeedlepoint and shit like that. I\u2019m just trying to make things \u2026 to have some tangible evidence of having lived this year.\u201d Of course, this is nothing the world hasn\u2019t heard before: we\u2019re well used to being told about the benefits of a digital detox. Still, it feels like an intriguing statement coming from Gracie Abrams. For one thing, her single That\u2019s So True spent most of January at No 1 in the UK: it spent most of November and December there as well, took a brief Christmas holiday, then reappeared to beat Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga et al once more. Her album The Secret of Us also reached No 1, and is now enjoying its 18th consecutive week in the Top 20, the kind of longevity only afforded to those artists who have broken through into the upper echelons of pop stardom. It\u2019s the same story back home in the US, where The Secret of Us has spent 35 weeks on the charts: her previous album managed two. Abrams is calling from Hamburg because it\u2019s the latest stop on a global tour that\u2019s been filling vast arenas for months and is scheduled to keep doing so until August. You see what she means about needlepoint, but you do wonder how much tangible evidence of having lived this year a person might need. Even by latterday pop standards, her rise seems particularly bound up with social media. She first broke through in 2020, with I Miss You, I\u2019m Sorry: a viral lockdown hit with its cheerfully amateurish, bedroom-bound video and lyrics that seemed to fit the prevalent mood (\u201cDo you remember happy together? I do, don\u2019t you?\u201d). She already had a major label deal, but was initially famed for directly interacting with her audience online: responding to their comments on SoundCloud and Instagram, sending them DMs, referring to them not as her fans but her \u201cfriends\u201d (\u201cmore friends than anyone has ever had ever!\u201d she told an interviewer in 2021); becoming the first non-Korean artist to use Weverse, the K-pop platform designed to offer \u201ca deeper level\u201d of artist-fan interaction than that of traditional social media. It\u2019s a smart way to build a committed fanbase, and it played into a pervasive idea of Abrams as what one writer called \u201cgen Z\u2019s most unfiltered storyteller\u201d: a singer-songwriter whose work was essentially private diary entries set to music, and who whispered her lyrics as if personally confiding in the listener. But it\u2019s clearly not an approach one can maintain after the kind of success garnered by The Secret of Us, an album noticeably brighter and less introverted than her previous work (the result, she says, of both \u201ca crush that I had felt way more significantly than in previous years\u201d and a new writing partnership with her best friend and roommate, Audrey Hobert). When you\u2019re packing out the Alsterdorfer Sportshalle and Madison Square Garden, not everyone online wants to be your friend. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not halted full stop,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are moments where I do feel really thrilled to interact directly; whether it\u2019s through a DM or a comment, I feel tapped into their lives still.\u201d But, she says, it\u2019s \u201cless frequent, because, honestly, mentally I don\u2019t benefit from engaging heavily in the way I used to. The way the algorithm works, if you spend five extra seconds reading a comment and there\u2019s a keyword with your name in it, that\u2019s what it starts to feed you. So I\u2019d open my phone in the morning and there would be lots of unsolicited opinions that were starting to make me feel sore, and then I would notice myself carrying that feeling. But if you don\u2019t engage with it, you don\u2019t feel so sick.\u201d Being tapped into your audiences\u2019 lives seems risky in an era when we hear a lot about toxic fandoms, when artists such as Chappell Roan feel compelled to call out fans for \u201ccreepy behaviour\u201d and \u201charassment\u201d. \u201cThe very large majority of the time I have been lucky, my interactions with fans out in the world haven\u2019t been ones that make me go \u2018oh shit\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve definitely had moments like that. I\u2019m walking with my headphones in, or my back is turned, or my head is down and a stranger comes in with a hug before anything else \u2026 that\u2019s really not a good feeling. As an animal, you\u2019re just like, \u2018Oh fuck, what\u2019s that?\u2019 Ninety per cent of the time it\u2019s really sweet introductions, or no crossing any lines with physical touch. But if you experience it even once, your guard can go up, because it feels unnatural. You want to walk a fine line between being attuned to what your audience feels and letting your own conviction guide you.\u201d The occasional over-familiar fan aside, Abrams\u2019 rise appears to have been remarkably smooth. Big names have flocked to work with her: The Secret of Us, like its predecessor Good Riddance, was made with the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner, best-known as Taylor Swift\u2019s chief latterday collaborator; Brian Eno unexpectedly cropped up on one track from Good Riddance. She has enjoyed a succession of profile-boosting celebrity co-signs. No sooner had I Miss You, I\u2019m Sorry appeared than Olivia Rodrigo announced that her forthcoming single was inspired by it \u2013 the forthcoming single turned out to be themulti-bn streaming Drivers License \u2013 while Taylor Swift selected her as the support act on two sizeable chunks of the record-breaking Eras tour and appears as a guest and co-writer on The Secret of Us. Abrams recently posted a photo of herself embracing her idol, Joni Mitchell, who was apparently unfazed even when Abrams showed her a tattoo she has featuring Mitchell\u2019s handwritten lyrics. She has pulled off the enviable trick of establishing a fanbase who feel her songs confide her innermost secrets to them, while also drawing a veil over her private life, only ever discussing it publicly in the vaguest terms (she is presumed to be in a relationship with actor Paul Mescal, but has never confirmed it to the wider world). \u201cSharing versus not sharing,\u201d she nods. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have this avenue, where, in my songs, I talk very openly about how I feel. It\u2019s like when I\u2019m writing, I\u2019m talking to myself. Talking to strangers, there are naturally things you hope to protect a bit more. Some things feel sacred.\u201d She seems smart, thoughtful and level-headed: at 25, she appears to be navigating the choppy waters of celebrity with admirable ease. This might have something to do with her background: her father is the Hollywood director/producer JJ Abrams. On the one hand, that means her success has played out to a constant background hum of sniping in which the phrase \u201cnepo baby\u201d figures heavily, but there are presumably worse preparations for fame than growing up in a celebrity-adjacent Hollywood family. Quite the opposite, she says: she was so introverted as a teenager that she thought a \u201cpublic-facing career\u201d was out of the question. \u201cI knew that it would involve performing, and that was the part that felt so horrifying to me. I wrote songs because it was easier than talking about my feelings. I wasn\u2019t interested in anybody hearing me. I was so turned off by the idea of confronting people face-to-face. That was what I loved about sharing music online \u2013 you could hide behind a profile.\u201d As her major label courted her, she kept her fears hidden. \u201cI remember signing my deal and feeling really nauseous about it.\u201d So what changed? \u201cWell, I see a therapist. And it hasn\u2019t been some overnight thing. The first shows I ever played were over Zoom during the pandemic, so that was like a baby step versus truly facing my fear head-on. Then I played the tiniest rooms\u201d \u2013 which, it should be noted, didn\u2019t stop her \u201cprojectile vomiting\u201d before going onstage \u2013 \u201cso it\u2019s almost like these tiny moments of exposure therapy.\u201d Clearly it worked: you don\u2019t see much evidence of introversion in the fan videos of her onstage, belting out I Miss You, I\u2019m Sorry from a set designed to look like the bedroom in which she recorded the song\u2019s original video, or lecturing audiences in a pre-election US about the necessity of voting when \u201cdemocracy is hanging by a thread\u201d. She was an ardent Harris supporter, and performed at one of her campaign rallies in Wisconsin. In the wake of the US election result, one theory that did the rounds was that the sheer wattage of celebrity endorsements Harris received was counterproductive \u2013 that they reinforced the notion that the Harris campaign was out of touch with ordinary voters\u2019 concerns in a difficult economic climate. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was counterproductive,\u201d Abrams frowns. \u201cThe issues were so much deeper, more systemic. How I feel about having played a tiny role in one of her many rallies that she crushed flawlessly every single time is that I\u2019m proud to have been there and proud to have felt that energy in the room. That was so tangible and so real, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve held on to since the results of the election. \u201cTrump has only been in office for a month and has already done everything in his power to make every marginalised community feel smaller, to make everybody more at risk, to overwhelm us with information, or disinformation, so that we feel powerless and hopeless. And what I felt at that rally in Wisconsin that day was the opposite of hopelessness: I felt real strength in gathering. That\u2019s the antidote right now. Obviously, there\u2019s got to be so much more we do when we gather in that way. But I feel really lucky to have witnessed in person what that kind of light feels like, especially now in the face of this quality of darkness. It\u2019s unprecedented, it\u2019s global.\u201d She was so crushed by Trump\u2019s victory that she wondered about going on tour at all. \u201cRight before going off, I was just like: how are we not all dedicating all of our time to fighting this \u2026 thing?\u201d She decided that \u201cif me, Gracie, in the position I\u2019m in in this world \u2013 like the luckiest ever \u2013 is feeling this way, then everybody is feeling this fucking way. I can give people who are coming to these shows two hours to feel everything they\u2019re feeling at an extreme, and be able to express it, or just distract themselves for two hours and recharge their battery. We\u2019re going to have to work out how to do that every single day, not just for the next four years, because obviously the impact of the next four years is going to be long-lasting.\u201d She says she spent a week at Dessner\u2019s studio before departing for Europe to work on new material, and found herself writing noticeably different kinds of songs than she expected. \u201cI was just like: shit, I don\u2019t even know how to articulate the degree to which I feel sick inside about everything. Most of those songs from that week are not about relationships. They\u2019re about the fact that LA just burned down, about the fact that I don\u2019t understand how we\u2019re supposed to really carry on. Of course those subjects will show up, it\u2019s life, but they\u2019re \u2026 different themes than I anticipated.\u201d But then, as she points out, nothing has turned out like she expected. \u201cAfter signing and starting to release music in a more real way, and after playing my first shows and realising I was wrong about how I felt about playing live because of the kindness of the people in the room, I started writing long letters to myself about dreams,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the things I wrote after my first show was \u2018One day I want to open for Taylor Swift\u2019. That was never going to happen, obviously. What\u2019s been so lucky is that the goalposts keep kind of moving and my imagination has expanded and I feel excited about being out of my comfort zone. \u201cBeing proved wrong about what was the scariest thing in the world to me at the time has made me really excited to be wrong about everything else.\u201d She laughs, before heading off to another packed arena. \u2022 Gracie Abrams\u2019 UK and Ireland tour begins Monday 3 March at Nottingham Motorpoint Arena. The Secret of Us is out now.",

        "headline": "The UK may be waning as a pop superpower \u2013 but a new generation is being nurtured",
        "trailText": "No British artists were in the top 10 biggest albums and singles globally last year. But big acts were between projects, and Charli xcx and Central Cee are hitting their stride",
        "bodyText": "For decades, Britain has traditionally punched massively above its weight when it comes to pop music: we\u2019re so used to providing the world with huge stars that the sight of a list of global bestselling albums and singles that doesn\u2019t contain a single UK artist comes as a jolt. The industry body IFPI has published its figures for 2024, and these charts are populated solely by American and South Korean artists. It tells you something about a market dramatically opened up by the rise of social media and streaming, which made music from outside the old Anglo-American pop axis more accessible and appealing. Four of the 10 biggest-selling albums of 2024 come from South Korea, a country that continues to exceed expectations, with 17m fewer people than the UK. It has proved infinitely more adept at marketing manufactured pop than Britain or the US in recent years, with K-pop fans actually spending money on albums: when you remove streaming from the equation and look at pure sales, 17 of the top 20 biggest global sellers are South Korean. Sales are helped along by fan-baiting multiple editions \u2013 Seventeen\u2019s two charting albums had 12 different versions between them \u2013 though Taylor Swift was the canniest in this regard: she released a total of 36 versions (19 of them physical editions) of The Tortured Poets Department, which duly tops the global album list. The trend for country or vaguely country-influenced pop over the last 12 months means that traditional Nashville star Morgan Wallen is in both charts, as is Noah Kahan, whose woody singer-songwriter strains are distantly related to country. It\u2019s a trend that militates against British artists; we\u2019re good at many things, but country is not traditionally our forte. Furthermore, it perhaps says something about the fact that Britain hasn\u2019t produced a new mainstream pop star striking or original enough to compete outside the confines of their homeland for several years. The highest-placed UK artist on IFPI\u2019s global singles chart, at No 15, was Artemas with I Like the Way You Kiss Me, though nothing on his mix tape Yustyna came close to its success and perhaps his style is too jaded to significantly cross over: his most recent song was named after a porn site. But Raye\u2019s next album could capitalise on the critical acclaim afforded her debut in the US, while Lola Young, whose UK No 1 single Messy is currently outstreaming hits by Lady Gaga, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter globally on Spotify, could be another bright prospect. And in fairness, the IFPI list isn\u2019t the full story. The absence of British names perhaps says less about a paucity of homegrown stars than the fact that some of the country\u2019s biggest artists \u2013 Harry Styles, Adele, Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi among them \u2013 are either on hiatus from releasing new music, or in the process of working on it. Meanwhile, you could hardly accuse Charli xcx\u2019s Brat of being an album that landed with insufficient impact, even if its sales weren\u2019t enough to elevate it into the year\u2019s Top 10 biggest sellers: Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign team changed the theme of its social media accounts to mirror that of the album after the singer endorsed the presidential candidate. Outside the period covered by the list, Central Cee\u2019s debut album Can\u2019t Rush Greatness entered the US charts at No 9: nothing to give Kendrick Lamar sleepless nights, but an achievement so extraordinary, given America\u2019s traditional resistance to rap artists from outside its borders, that it would have seemed completely unimaginable even a few years ago. Tellingly, both Charli xcx and Central Cee have taken a long time to reach their commercial zenith: Brat is the former\u2019s sixth album, Can\u2019t Rush Greatness arrived nearly eight years after the latter\u2019s debut EP. There\u2019s a lesson about allowing artists to develop, rather than expecting immediate results, which perhaps the British music industry has heeded. After a period in which major labels would apparently alight on anything that had gone viral on social media, which yielded short-term success but little longevity (you may recall their brief faith in the questionable notion that sea shanties were very much the coming thing in 2020), they\u2019re currently claiming to set great store in taking a longer view when it comes to what they sign. It\u2019s the right thing to do: we\u2019ll have to wait to see if it yields results.",
