        "bodyText": "Ed Sheeran\u2019s new single arrives at an interesting point in his career. His last albums, 2023\u2019s Subtract and Autumn Variations, felt not unlike a riff on Taylor Swift\u2019s pandemic-era Folklore and Evermore: two albums released in the same year, produced by the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner, a little woodier and more understated in tone than usual. Subtract in particular enjoyed the kind of critical acclaim that Sheeran\u2019s work seldom attracts. They were also the first Sheeran albums not to yield a billion-streaming track: his commercial zenith, 2017\u2019s Divide, contained five, among them Shape of You, one of only two songs in history have to topped 4bn streams on Spotify. Maybe a muted commercial response was part of the plan (or rather, a relatively muted commercial response by Sheeran\u2019s standards: Subtract still went to No 1 in 13 countries). Having spent a decade voraciously pursuing vast success \u2013 and shifting 200m albums in the process \u2013 perhaps Sheeran had decided the moment was right to deliberately pull back, to do precisely what he wanted regardless of the sales figures. At first glance, Azizam seems like another supporting claim for that theory. It\u2019s billed as a \u201ccross-cultural collaboration\u201d, an experiment in Persian music inspired by the Iranian heritage of Stockholm-based producer Ilya Salmanzadeh (co-author of hits including Sam Smith\u2019s Unholy, Ellie Goulding\u2019s Love Me Like You Do and Ariana Grande\u2019s Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored). The title is Farsi for \u201cmy dear one\u201d, and its cast list involves an array of musicians playing Middle Eastern instruments such at the daf and santur, as well as the Citizens of the World Choir, which is made up of refugees and their allies. But once you hear the end result, it has pretty much the same relation to Persian music as Galway Girl did to sean-n\u00f3s singing. There\u2019s a noticeable lope to the rhythm that could well have its roots in Tehran, but could just as easily be an echo of the deathless glitterbeat that sprang out of early 70s glam. There\u2019s a Middle Eastern cast to a counter-melody that appears during the chorus, but the rest is positively Anglo-Saxon: percussive acoustic guitar to the fore, a big chorus and a hearty vocal with lyrics about dancing with his wife. Azizam does its job with the kind of ruthless efficiency you might expect from Sheeran in unabashed pop mode. It has a hook that fully digs into your brain the first time you hear it, and proves impossible to dislodge thereafter: whether you consider that delightful or insufferable will depend entirely on your previously established opinion of Sheeran and his work. Whether it will restore him to the realm of billion-streamers is also open to question. Pop is widely held to have entered a new era, more brash and risky and characterful than the one that bore Sheeran to success in the first place, heralded by the rise of Chappell Roan and the success of Charli xcx\u2019s Brat. But less widely reported is the fact that, new era or not, Sheeran still casts a long shadow over pop: Noah Kahan, Benson Boone and man currently at UK No 1, Alex Warren, have a considerable chunk of Sheeran in their musical DNA; Myles Smith, winner of the Rising Star award at this year\u2019s Brits, seems to have modelled himself so closely that he\u2019s even adopted Sheeran\u2019s trademark short-scale acoustic guitar. You wouldn\u2019t bank against Azizam muscling its way back to the top table. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2025. An earlier version made reference to the ghatam, a south Indian instrument, but described it as Middle Eastern.",

        "trailText": "The star\u2019s new single, Azizam, is a rare pop-cultural moment in which Iran is celebrated for the beauty of its culture",
        "bodyText": "As a second-generation Persian immigrant, my connection with my roots has always been relatively surface-level. Admiring the intricate artworks adorning the walls of our homes, hand-loomed rugs crafted by my own grandmother, barberry-laden rice and saffron-infused stews, the music of Googoosh, Bijan Mortazavi and Susan Roshan blasting from dawn to dusk. My parents spoke Farsi to one another and to me when I was a child and as such it was my mother tongue. But I was born in Australia, so it was only going to be a matter of time before I became more proficient in English. Now I stumble my way through conversations in broken Farsi, longing for the day when Iran will be safe enough to finally visit and I can hopefully scrub up my language skills. My parents have never returned to Iran. Not since they left at the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 due to their belief in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith \u2013 a religion promoting the unity of mankind whose adherents have been persecuted in Iran since its inception in the mid 19th century. The closest my mother has ever been to her homeland was last year, when we stopped over in Qatar on our way to France. Iran has had a bad rap over the years; many in the west associate it with terrorism, religious extremism and crimes against humanity. And for good reason. It\u2019s constantly under scrutiny for its oppression of women and other minority groups, and its identity is framed by the media\u2019s negative portrayal of the country, its people and regime. And then, a white man sings. Ed Sheeran has released a new single titled Azizam, which translates to \u201cmy dear\u201d or \u201cmy love\u201d in Farsi \u2013 and the diaspora is going wild. The song was written and produced alongside Iranian-born Swedish songwriter Ilya Salmanzadeh. While the melody is all western pop, the Middle Eastern influences are clear, with instruments including the daf and santoor making a welcome appearance. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning My own children, who are Persian-Canadian and born in Australia, have always grappled with their cultural identity. When they heard Sheeran\u2019s new song, they were euphoric. Here was a piece of music that was crossing cultural boundaries, allowing them to piece together who they were \u2013 albeit superficially. A white person, like them, singing in Farsi, also like them! Recently, Persian comedian Maz Jobrani posted a short explainer on his Instagram about why Persians are so excited about the new song, saying: \u201cEver since we came to the west, we\u2019ve been getting negative press. From the hostage crisis, to the movie Not Without My Daughter \u2026 so anytime anyone in the west does anything remotely good about us, we get excited!\u201d For so long, Iran has been regarded as just a country in peril. With Sheeran\u2019s new song, the western world can now catch a glimpse of the beauty, excitement and life that has been harboured within the country \u2013 if only it had the freedom to share it more liberally. For my entire life, my parents made sure I knew that Iran was a country with potential. Over thousands of years, since ancient Persian civilisation, our culture has influenced fashion, architecture and language. The contributions it has made to art, music, faith and science are some of the most profound the world has ever known. We want the beauty of our culture to define us. The fact that Iran continues to commit the most cruel and intense human rights crimes is a cause for lament both in the country and beyond. Azizam was inspired by Sheeran\u2019s wife, but it\u2019s much more than a love song. It\u2019s a showcase of the beauty inherent in Iran, and a reconceptualisation of its identity. To those who emigrated or fled, it is an ode to their own homeland; it evokes a yearning to reunite with their beloved. To those in the broader diaspora, it\u2019s a connection with their heritage. When Sheeran releases the entire song in Farsi, I can just imagine the weddings, celebrations and mehmoonis (Persian gatherings) blasting the song from dawn to dusk; the chant becoming a rally cry reminiscent of the glory days \u2013 albeit in broken Farsi.",

        "bodyText": "Ed Sheeran has been stopped by police from busking in India after he was told he lacked permissions. The songwriter was seen singing the hit single Shape of You on a pavement in the southern city of Bengaluru before his concert on Sunday night. But a viral video clip shows a police officer walking up to Sheeran while he is singing with the crowd and unplugging the microphone, as onlookers jeer. A dismayed Sheeran puts down his guitar and walks off. Police said event organisers had been refused permission for the performance, which was in one of the busiest areas of a city of 12 million people that is notorious for its heavy traffic. A Bengaluru police official, Shekar T Tekkannanavar, told the news agency ANI: \u201cI refused to give permission because Church Street gets very crowded. That is the reason he was asked to vacate the place.\u201d But Sheeran, who is known for performing in unexpected places, insisted later on his Instagram account that he did have permission to perform Shape of You, which was the first song to reach 3bn streams on Spotify. He wrote: \u201cWe had permission to busk, by the way. Hence, us playing in that exact spot was planned out beforehand. It wasn\u2019t just us randomly turning up. All good, though.\u201d Fans shared their disappointment at the police decision on social media. PC Mohan, a local MP from the ruling BJP party, posted on X that the impromptu gig had taken on a \u201csour note\u201d when police arrived, adding that \u201ceven global stars must follow local rules \u2013 no permit, no performance\u201d. The artist is in India for a 15-day leg of his tour, The Mathematics, and performed in front of thousands of people at an open ground in Bengaluru later that night, accompanied by the Indian singer Shilpa Rao. He surprised fans by singing two hit songs in the Telugu language with Rao on stage. He performed two nights in Bengaluru on 8 and 9 February after an extra show was added due to huge demand.",

        "bodyText": "Ed Sheeran has said he would rather not be on the forthcoming 40th-anniversary version of Band Aid charity single Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, aligning himself with criticism of it as dehumanising and damaging to Africans. Sheeran is one of an all-star cast to be drawn from three previous recordings of the song, in 1984, 2004 and 2014 \u2013 he appeared on the latter version. Producer Trevor Horn has mashed up three sets of performances into a new \u201cUltimate Mix\u201d, which will be released on 25 November, and also features George Michael, Robbie Williams, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor and many more. Writing on Instagram, Sheeran said: \u201cMy approval wasn\u2019t sought on this new Band Aid 40 release and had I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals. A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed.\u201d Sheeran shared a post by British-Ghanaian vocalist Fuse ODG, saying it \u201celoquently explained\u201d his feelings about the song. Fuse ODG wrote of charity initiatives such as Band Aid: \u201cWhile they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa\u2019s economic growth, tourism and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity. By showcasing dehumanising imagery, these initiatives fuel pity rather than partnership, discouraging meaningful engagement.\u201d Fuse ODG said he wanted to \u201creclaim the narrative \u2026 today, the diaspora drives the largest flow of funds back into the continent, not Band Aid or foreign aid, proving that Africa\u2019s solutions and progress lie in its own hands\u201d. Band Aid has raised over \u00a3150m since being founded in 1984, including via the song \u2013 which topped the charts on each of its three releases \u2013 and the US-UK benefit concerts Live Aid. It originally targeted famine relief in Ethiopia and has since expanded to charitable efforts across Africa. But the song has been criticised for a paternalistic and generalising attitude towards Africans, and had its lyrics changed in 2014, including Bono\u2019s climatic line \u201cWell tonight thank God it\u2019s them, instead of you\u201d which was changed to \u201cWell tonight we\u2019re reaching out and touching you\u201d. Fuse ODG was invited to appear on that version, but declined, writing in the Guardian at the time: \u201cI, like many others, am sick of the whole concept of Africa \u2013 a resource-rich continent with unbridled potential \u2013 always being seen as diseased, infested and poverty-stricken.\u201d Sheeran is gearing up to release his own Christmas song, Under the Tree, taken from the soundtrack to new Netflix film That Christmas, co-written by Richard Curtis and adapted from his children\u2019s books. It stars Brian Cox as Santa Claus, with Jodie Whittaker, Fiona Shaw and Bill Nighy among the supporting cast.",

        "trailText": "Coldplay, Harry Styles and Stormzy also join Suffolk songwriter in campaigning for music funding in schools",
        "bodyText": "Elton John, Coldplay, Harry Styles, Stormzy and Central Cee are among the artists backing a call from Ed Sheeran for Keir Starmer to commit \u00a3250m of funding for music education. As part of his newly launched Ed Sheeran Foundation, the Suffolk songwriter is campaigning for music funding in schools, training for music teachers, funding for grassroots venues and spaces, apprenticeships in music and a more diverse music curriculum. Sheeran wrote: \u201cAs an industry, we bring in \u00a37.6bn into the UK economy, yet the next generation is not there to take the reins. Last year was the first in over 20 years without a UK global top 10 single or album in the charts.\u201d Sheeran has called upon the government to provide a cross-departmental taskforce to work together on these issues to ensure music education remains high on the agenda. The letter continued: \u201cThe time to act is now. State schools \u2013 which educate 93% of the country\u2019s children \u2013 have seen a 21% decrease in music provision \u2026 we also need you standing up for music education. Artists and industry can\u2019t deliver on the world stage for the UK without schools, youth clubs and stages at home. \u201cWe collectively ask for a \u00a3250m UK music education package this spring to repair decades of dismantling music \u2026 Music in and out of school should be for all, not a few.\u201d A 2025 report by Music Mark, the UK association for music education, found that the Labour government had inherited a \u00a3161.4m shortfall in its budget to ensure the future of music education over the next five years. Before winning the 2024 election, Starmer \u2013 a former child flautist who has spoken of the joys of travelling with his youth orchestra \u2013 told Classic FM that he \u201cpassionately\u201d wanted to reverse the \u201cdegrading of creative arts and music\u201d in state schools. Annie Lennox, Dave, Paloma Faith, YolanDa Brown and Sleaford Mods are also among the 500 signatories from the music industry. The Brit awards Rising Star winner Myles Smith has also signed; at the awards ceremony last month, he called on the government, venue conglomerates and music executives to support emerging artists. \u201cHow many more venues need to close, how many music programmes need to be cut before we realise that we can\u2019t just celebrate success, we have to protect the foundations that make it?\u201d he asked. Arts advocates are hoping Labour\u2019s long-awaited curriculum review, led by Prof Becky Francis, will lead to a boost for the arts and greater educational inclusion, closing the access gap between state and private schools, and those in wealthy and less well-off areas. In 2022, the Conservative government published the second iteration of its national plan for music education, emphasising the \u201cpower of music to change lives\u201d. It proposed that all children and young people should be able to learn to sing, play an instrument and create music together, and have the opportunity to progress their musical interests, including at a professional level. But music studies in schools are at a historic low. In August, the Independent Society of Musicians reported a 43% drop in A-level applicants and almost 40% in GCSE applicants since 2010, when then-education secretary, Michael Gove, introduced the Ebacc qualification, which does not include music or art. Last year, the Cultural Learning Alliance found that 42% of state schools enter no pupils for GCSE music. Femi Koleoso, a drummer with Ezra Collective, also advocated for support for music education when the London jazz band won group of the year at the Brit awards. The ensemble formed in 2016 after meeting through the Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors youth jazz programme. Their victory, Koleoso said, was \u201cbecause of the great youth clubs and the great teachers and the great schools\u2019 that supported young people playing music. \u201cThe reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, where we\u2019re unsure of how to fix it \u2026 the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies with giving a young person a saxophone, because when you do that you give them a dream and aspiration and a goal,\u201d he added. Sheeran previously called for public funding for music in schools in 2023. He signed a letter from Andrew Lloyd Webber to Starmer and Rishi Sunak, calling for funding to scale up the work of Lloyd Webber\u2019s music education charity, the Music in Secondary Schools Trust, which provides free musical instruments and weekly music lessons in disadvantaged schools. A government spokesperson said: \u201cHigh and rising standards are at the heart of this government\u2019s mission to break down barriers to opportunity and we are committed to ensuring art, music and drama are no longer the preserve of a privileged few. \u201cTo help achieve this our curriculum and assessment review will seek to deliver a broader curriculum, and our new national centre for music and arts education will promote opportunities for children and young people to pursue their artistic and creative interests in school. \u201cWe are also expanding the creative careers programme to \u00a33m over the next financial year, to help provide even more schoolchildren with information, advice and guidance on creative career routes.\u201d",

        "trailText": "With its Iranian melodies, instrumentation and backing singers, Sheeran\u2019s joyful new single is a reminder of how culture transcends borders",
        "bodyText": "The Farsi word \u201cazizam\u201d \u2013 meaning my dear or my darling in English \u2013 may not have the same level of global resonance as habibi or ma ch\u00e9rie, but to us Persians it\u2019s a daily refrain. We use it with our family, partners, friends; my cat probably thinks it\u2019s her middle name by now. So it felt huge when Ed Sheeran announced that the lead single from his new album would be called just that: Azizam. The track, inspired by the Iranian heritage of Stockholm-based producer Ilya Salmanzadeh, has divided critics, with a Telegraph review calling it \u201ca slice of pure pop froth that couldn\u2019t be any more generic and upbeat if it was written by an AI programme\u201d. But these reproaches are missing a whole other dimension: that the song has triggered a huge emotional response from millions of Iranians around the world. \u201cHearing a beloved artist embrace our language with such care? We feel it. And we\u2019re here for it,\u201d said one popular comment on Sheeran\u2019s Instagram. For so long, Iranians have become used to being ostracised or misrepresented in western popular culture. Take the movie 300, a fictional retelling of the Greco-Persian wars, in which the Persians were essentially depicted as barbarians; or Ben Affleck\u2019s Argo, about the Iran hostage crisis, which stereotyped Iranians as fanatical and ignorant. \u201cIf you\u2019re an Iranian and you live in the diaspora, you understand what it\u2019s like to be misunderstood, especially if you grew up in the post 9/11 era,\u201d a TikTok user said. \u201cNon-Iranians or people who aren\u2019t from the Middle East don\u2019t understand how beautiful our culture is, our language, our history and our struggle, what we\u2019ve been through.\u201d So having one of the world\u2019s best-selling artists celebrate that beauty has got to mean something. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to have a lot of non-Iranians be like \u2026 \u2018what a beautiful word\u2019.\u201d Persians are incredibly proud of our culture and history. Iranians will be quick to tell you that Persia is the world\u2019s oldest continuous civilisation, that poets like Rumi and Hafez and Ferdowsi influenced literary traditions for centuries. Many still love to claim Freddie Mercury \u2013 or \u201cFarrokh joon\u201d (dear Farrokh) \u2013 as one of our own (his parents were Parsi, an ethnic group descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India in the eighth century). And Ed Sheeran will heretofore surely be known as Ed Shirini (\u201csweets\u201d in Farsi), or as the comedian Shaparak Khorsandi joked in the manner of a typical Persian mum, Sheeran derives from Eee-ran anyway. Yes, I tell my friends, Brian Cox is a fantastic actor, but more importantly did you know he and his Persian wife\u2019s cat is called Pishi (Persian for kitty)? Yes, Animal was a massive Bollywood hit, but did you know the song that enthralled Indian audiences from the film is a 50s Iranian tune? Critics have called Azizam inauthentic and derivative, but I disagree \u2013 it has a real Iranian flavour. This includes its hook, the use of instruments like the daf and santur, and backing vocals from huge Iranian pop stars Arash and Andy, the latter of whom delighted fans by playing it at a recent concert and saying he felt \u201cdeeply connected\u201d to the song. There\u2019s also a full Farsi version coming, featuring a singer \u201cwho\u2019s as big as it gets in the Persian community\u201d according to Sheeran. Then there\u2019s the fact that it was released during Nowruz, the Persian new year marking the spring equinox, which is a time of celebration and coming together to eat (including a lot of shirini of course), give gifts and dance. This song will have been played in Iranian households around the world. The video alone amassed more than 8m views in two days, Tik Tok is full of Iranians \u201cgher\u201d-ing to it \u2013 that irresistible feeling that makes you want to shake your hips on the dancefloor \u2013 and the song will undoubtedly be played at Iranian weddings for years to come. But there is a deeper message: however fraught international relations become, culture can still bring us together. Sheeran has played to this before, collaborating with west African pop stars such as Burna Boy and Fireboy DML, and he learned Spanish for a record with Colombian singer J Balvin. Cynics have suggested this is canny, even craven: a way of courting a series of global audiences to expand Sheeran\u2019s brand. More generally, exploitative sampling or insensitive imitation of global-majority artists has of course resulted in plenty of cultural appropriation over the years. But there\u2019s evident joy in the way Sheeran sings over these fusions, and splicings of MENA music and British pop are often creative as well as commercial successes, as proved by the Chemical Brothers\u2019 Galvanize, Blur\u2019s Out of Time, or Coldplay\u2019s recent We Pray, featuring Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna. Sheeran said the similarity of the Middle Eastern instruments on Azizam to the Irish traditional music he grew up with brought home how much \u201cmusic connects us all and really is a universal language\u201d. There\u2019s no better representation of that than online videos of an American crowd in a pub in Ipswich, Massachusetts last week, blaring out \u201cazizam\u201d in unison. Jimmy Fallon even sang it on the Tonight Show. So for that, and all the above, I\u2019ll simply say: Ed, you are our azizam.",

        "headline": "Ed Sheeran, Fuse ODG: do they know they\u2019re dead right about Band Aid? Africa needs more than a singalong ",
        "trailText": "No wonder pop stars and others feel uneasy about the project. However well-intentioned, it now does more harm than good, says author and broadcaster Nels Abbey",
        "bodyText": "Hey y\u2019all: listen up to the chartbusting, pop-pickin\u2019, time-addled DJ: \u201cYes indeed, Band Aid\u2019s Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas is back with a bang, a twist and a mix! This time our ultimate white saviour anthem is ready for for a generation weaned on AI remixes: a menage a trois of the original 1984 version mixed in with the 2004 and 2014 versions. Britain is about to feel good and \u201cAfrica\u201d is finally about to get fed! WICK-ED! Joining us to discuss this is my mate, a fountain of all that is good in the world, the great Sir Bob Geldof \u2026\u201d We don\u2019t know exactly what the forthcoming, 40th-anniversary version of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, featuring a mashup of previous versions into a new \u201cultimate mix\u201d, will sound like. But I do fear the worst. So does Ed Sheeran, who is currently the 10th most-listened-to artist on Spotify and one of the stars of the 2014 version of Band Aid. Following the lead of British-Ghanaian Afrobeats star Fuse ODG, Sheeran has taken a principled stand against his unauthorised inclusion in the re-release. \u201cMy approval wasn\u2019t sought on this new Band Aid 40 release, and had I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals. A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed.\u201d Very well said. In a video released online, Fuse ODG painstakingly detailed the effect of Band Aid: \u201cWhile they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa\u2019s economic growth, tourism and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity. By showcasing dehumanising imagery, these initiatives fuel pity rather than partnership, discouraging meaningful engagement.\u201d In a just world, Fuse ODG would be showered with honours for his work on uplifting the image of Africa and helping to bring African music into popular culture. In the process, he helped to do the opposite of absolutely everything that he suggested Band Aid does. As I type these words, I am sitting by a pool in a hotel in Lagos \u2013 by dint of population, the Blackest place on Earth. To my left is a group of American business people and to my right a group of young British and Nigerian tourists. A table full of Chinese and Nigerian business people is not far from us. Though chronic poverty remains a serious issue, the signs of hard development and investment are stark. This is no easy achievement. My previous career in financial services left me with a vivid and vicious understanding of how difficult it was to raise investment for African ventures \u2013 no matter how polished your PowerPoint deck was, no matter how great or persuasive a presenter you were, how enticing the potential profits looked. It is unbelievably hard to compete with shocking imagery, children with flies on their faces, charity videos broadcast on TV every 15 minutes. Those adverts became the dominant perspective of the motherland. The power of Band Aid\u2019s celebrity helped ensure that generations of Brits inherited this perspective of a hopeless Africa. Thankfully, initiatives such as Pledge for Change are helping to right that wrong. But Band Aid had an even darker impact. However well-intentioned, it turned out to be a western soft power coup and an assault on Africa. It arrived on the centenary of the 1884 Berlin Conference, at which European imperial powers grappled for control of Africa. So in 1984, at the very moment Britain and other western states should have been reflecting on the impact of that scramble and the subsequent explosion of colonisation, the British entertainment establishment released a charity single \u201cfor Africa\u201d. This completely overshadowed any discussion of Britain\u2019s and other western nations\u2019 complicity in the very plight they were supposedly trying to help relieve. This became something of a tradition: the 2004 version of Band Aid eclipsed the 120th anniversary of the Berlin Conference, the 2014 version did the same for the 130th. Guess what? We\u2019re now at the 140th anniversary of the Berlin Conference and \u2013 SURPRISE \u2013 we\u2019re speaking about Band Aid and not the colonialism that created an opening for it to exist. The BBC plans to \u201cmark\u201d the 40th anniversary of Band Aid with a documentary \u201ccomplete with footage that has never been broadcast\u201d. And yet it was pretty mute on the 140th anniversary of the Berlin Conference (as it was the other landmark anniversaries of the conference \u2013 which helps explain why so many have never heard of it). Instead of a serious conversation about reparations or a Marshall plan for Africa, we get super dehumanising adverts seeking 50p a month and a well-timed national singalong that we trot out at the exact moment we should be speaking about economic justice and repair. Fuse ODG, Ed Sheeran, and other critics: they\u2019re on to something. If people want to take a view of how to make this a fairer world, I applaud that. But we need long-term solutions. Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas, however well meant, is just a charity singalong. These days, that doesn\u2019t cut it.

        "trailText": "California music festival to see record highs and headlining sets from Lady Gaga, Post Malone and Green Day",
        "bodyText": "Stars such as Lady Gaga, Charli xcx, Ed Sheeran and Missy Elliott will face blazing temperatures this weekend at an unusually hot Coachella festival. The California-based festival will soar to potentially record-breaking highs of 103F (over 39C) in its first of two consecutive weekends, about 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit higher than what\u2019s typically expected at this time of year. The festival, which usually attracts around 125,000 people a day, is following a year that saw its slowest sales to date, headlined by Doja Cat, Lana del Rey and Tyler, the Creator. The 2025 edition is being viewed by some as an unofficial comeback with headliners Lady Gaga, Green Day and Post Malone, who together boast 24% higher global Spotify streams than the previous trio. Gaga previously headlined Coachella in 2017, when she also filmed scenes for A Star Is Born. In a recent interview, she said she would focus on her new album, Mayhem, but also give fans the older hits they want. She said she saw it as \u201can opportunity to do something unique and special\u201d but remained tightlipped about specifics. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t want to give anything away about Coachella,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that is heartless of me, in a way, but I could honestly cry on the phone with you just thinking about how excited I am to do this show, and I want it to be a total surprise, and want everyone to have as much fun as possible.\u201d The lineup boasts a wide variety of acts from different genres and eras. The newer guard is represented by Lola Young, Shaboozey, Amyl and the Sniffers, Rema, underscores and Glorilla, while nostalgia plays are led by Jimmy Eat World, Missy Elliott, Kraftwerk, Basement Jaxx and the Go-Gos. The weekend will also see the Prodigy play, returning to Coachella for the first time since Keith Flint died in 2019. \u201cI will say that us carrying on isn\u2019t a Keith tribute show,\u201d band member Liam Howlett recently told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe want to honor him, and we will continue to do that, because Keith is more than just a person they saw on stage. Even though he wasn\u2019t a musician, he was such an important person in the studio as a right-hand man.\u201d Another throwback act playing is Weezer, a band who have been making headlines this week after bassist Scott Shriner\u2019s wife, Jillian Lauren, was shot by police. Reports claim that she aimed a handgun at officers as they investigated an unrelated hit-and-run incident and she is now being charged with attempted murder. The band is still set to perform as scheduled with Scott saying \u201csee you at Coachella\u201d to journalists on Thursday. One act who won\u2019t be performing is FKA twigs, who was forced to pull out \u201cdue to ongoing visa issues\u201d related to her production team reportedly failing to fill out the correct paperwork in time. The star wrote that she was \u201cdevastated\u201d in an Instagram statement. Rising costs and more complicated logistics have also caused trouble for other artists seeking visas to perform. \u201cI just did visas for a Coachella band and it was $8,000,\u201d a booking agency executive told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a huge financial hurdle because it takes so long through regular channels, you have to go for the heavy-duty expediting.\u201d",

        "trailText": "All-star version of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, spliced together from previous versions, falls short of the No 1 success of those earlier hits",
        "bodyText": "The 40th anniversary version of Band Aid\u2019s Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? has failed to enter this week\u2019s Top 40, reaching No 45. The new version of the song was made up of performances spliced together from three previous versions, in an arrangement by producer Trevor Horn. But despite featuring the unusual A-list juxtaposition of George Michael, Sinead O\u2019Connor, Chris Martin, One Direction and more, the new version has not yet matched the success of its predecessors, which each went straight to No 1 in 1984, 2004 and 2014. The 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix has struggled even though streams and sales of the original 1984 version also count towards its chart performance. But as it was released on Monday rather than Friday, the new version did not benefit from a full week of chart sales data, and could yet continue up the charts as the Christmas season progresses. The single \u2013 which features new cover art by Sir Peter Blake \u2013 continues the charity work of Band Aid, which was founded to raise funds for those affected by famine in Ethiopia, and continues to support a range of humanitarian projects there and across Africa. The song\u2019s new version also features the original 1984 news reporting by Michael Buerk on the famine, which helped to bring the country\u2019s plight to wider attention in the UK, and inspired the original Band Aid song as well as the Live Aid concerts the following year. The 40th anniversary version has been criticised in some quarters, as have previous versions. Ed Sheeran, whose 2014 vocals appear on the new version, said ahead of its release: \u201cHad I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals\u201d. He cited criticism by British-Ghanaian musician Fuse ODG, who wrote in his own statement that charity initiatives such as Band Aid \u201cperpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa\u2019s economic growth, tourism and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity\u201d. Bob Geldof, who founded Band Aid and co-wrote Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? with Midge Ure, defended the song in light of Fuse ODG\u2019s criticism. He told CNN that he, along with Kofi Annan and others, had previously travelled Africa \u201clobbying exactly for what Fuse is saying\u201d regarding the ability for African countries to be self-sustaining: \u201cYou inject the oil of cash into an economy and people fly.\u201d But, he added, for African people \u201cto be able to get Africa going and on its feet, they must be alive, and over the course of 40 years, hundreds of thousands of people, probably millions, are alive because of a little pop song. That is a ridiculous way to run the world and it should stop, but while it doesn\u2019t, we will continue \u2026 doing this little song.\u201d Earlier this month, responding to an article that argued the song perpetuated \u201ccolonial tropes\u201d, he wrote: \u201c\u2018Colonial tropes\u2019 my arse \u2026 There IS endemic hunger due to the unforgiving soil conditions. Water IS scarce save for a scattering of unreliable wells. Rain IS increasingly unreliable \u2026 These are not \u2018colonial tropes\u2019 they are empirical facts.\u201d The new version of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? was outperformed by a number of other Christmas classics, with Wham\u2019s Last Christmas at No 8 and Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want For Christmas Is You at No 10 before December has even begun. Eight other Christmas songs are in the Top 40, with Brenda Lee\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree at No 20, followed by Ariana Grande\u2019s Santa Tell Me (27), Bobby Helms\u2019 Jingle Bell Rock (30), Ed Sheeran and Elton John\u2019s Merry Christmas (31), Kelly Clarkson\u2019s Underneath the Tree (32), the Pogues\u2019 Fairytale of New York (34), Andy Williams\u2019 It\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year (39) and Shakin\u2019 Stevens\u2019 Merry Christmas Everyone (40). In the album chart, Kendrick Lamar goes to No 1 with GNX in its first week of release, his second No 1 album following 2015\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly. Three of the album\u2019s songs (the maximum allowed under chart rules) reached the Top 10 of the singles chart. At No 4, Squabble Up becomes Lamar\u2019s highest-charting solo single, while Luther is at No 5 and TV Off reaches No 6.",

        "trailText": "With southern-gothic storytelling and a soulfully diverse sound, the Kentucky singer revolutionised the double-denim country scene. But as the US election hots up, he\u2019s staying out of the culture wars",
        "bodyText": "Chris Stapleton has played five arenas in the UK over the past week, on a tour dubbed the All-American Road Show. Posters depicted his grandly bearded, cowboy-hatted visage framed by hills and skies in colours of red, white and blue. At first listen, his country music seems just as all-American. The 46-year-old has been writing and singing about women, heartbreak and drinkin\u2019 for more than 20 years \u2013 whiskey alone has prompted Tennessee Whiskey (originally recorded by David Allan Coe), Whiskey and You, Whiskey Sunrise and his version of Willie Nelson\u2019s Whiskey River; Stapleton recently launched his own brand of the stuff, Traveller. He\u2019s sung the national anthem at the Super Bowl, and duetted with Taylor Swift. When discussing the upcoming election in November, I can almost hear a bald eagle cry as he declares: \u201cI\u2019m voting for America and a good glass of whiskey.\u201d But Stapleton, a true American superstar with 10 Grammys and 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, is rather more complicated than your average truck-drivin\u2019 country singer \u2013 and he\u2019s all too aware of the stereotypes. His atmospheric 2020 song Hillbilly Blood is less a country number and more a string of southern-gothic vignettes, \u201cborn out of a riff that sounded pretty mean\u201d, and inspired by his native Kentucky. \u201cThe people where I\u2019m from, sometimes we\u2019re looked down upon as not as educated or not as smart, or that we don\u2019t have much money, or any of those things,\u201d he says. On his biggest recent hit, White Horse, he sounds like a classically macho country-rocker \u2013 until you realise he\u2019s running away from love, too afraid to be a heroic \u201ccowboy on a white horse / ridin\u2019 off into the sunset\u201d. As well as the Swift duet, there\u2019s another with Metallica. And while country peers such as Jason Aldean have recently been dealing in aggressive nationalism, Stapleton is writing songs like Watch You Burn, a furious anthem about the 2017 mass shooting at Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas, where 60 people were killed. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you write songs sometimes that are timely,\u201d he says, over the phone. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our duty as songwriters, to connect with people in those ways: anger and frustration.\u201d He certainly has the quintessential country roots, though: while Loretta Lynn sang of being a coalminer\u2019s daughter, Stapleton is a coalminer\u2019s son, and his mother worked at the local health department. He grew up in Staffordsville, a small, \u201cthree stoplight\u201d rural town, where \u201cthe Friday night football game was the big gathering of the week, then it was church on Sundays. That was kind of it.\u201d His earliest musical memories are of playing guitar with his uncle, and of his dad playing outlaw country and old R&amp;B in the car. \u201cWhen my mom wasn\u2019t in the car it would be a little louder than it should have been for children, probably,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cBut he loved to listen to music, and a lot of my love for my music probably comes from that.\u201d He went to Nashville to study biomedical engineering at Vanderbilt University, then switched to business school, but he \u201cjust didn\u2019t have an interest in doing any of that \u2013 a very strong disinterest, in fact\u201d. Having taught himself guitar to a decent standard, he realised he could have a career in music when he met a salaried songwriter at EMI around the turn of the millennium. \u201cI had no idea that was a job,\u201d he says. He assumed if someone was singing a song, they wrote it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was an entire community of people who, behind the scenes, were kind of song-factories. I became enamoured with that very quickly, and said: \u2018Well, this is the job that I need to have.\u2019\u201d Over the next decade or so, Stapleton earned a reputation as a prolific, versatile songwriter for country stars old (Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, George Strait), and new (Luke Bryan, Dierks Bentley, Blake Shelton). In 2015, he even had the great honour of seeing a song he\u2019d co-written with Thomas Rhett, South Side, performed by animated rodents in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. Stapleton had become another of Nashville\u2019s song factories \u2013 he reckons he\u2019s written more than 1,000 of them \u2013 but he never felt \u201clike a cog in a machine. That\u2019s not very romantic or sexy, but it was romantic. To get to dig in with all the people that I had gotten to dig in with \u2013 the best of the best in the country music songwriter world \u2013 was a real privilege: \u2018the art behind the art\u2019 kinda thing.\u201d In this environment, Stapleton never felt compelled to perform himself \u2013 \u201cWhy would I? \u2013 but he had a number of \u201cperfectly good songs sitting around going to waste\u201d. So he formed a bluegrass band to play them called the SteelDrivers, followed by southern rockers the Jompson Brothers, before going solo. \u201cMy wife thought I was crazy because it was an income hit to go on tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably gave up 40% of my income just because I wasn\u2019t working as hard at songwriting.\u201d The title track of Stapleton\u2019s debut album, Traveller, was composed while he and his wife, the singer-songwriter Morgane Stapleton, drove through New Mexico in 2013 (they met while working in adjacent publishing houses, married in 2007 and now have five children). The road trip had been her idea: she spent $10,000 on a Jeep in Phoenix, Arizona, and the 1,600-mile drive back to Nashville would be a welcome distraction for Stapleton, whose father had just died. \u201cThe whole record in a lot of ways was dedicated to him,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cI tried to make a record that I thought he would have liked to have heard be made. I miss my father a great deal \u2013 he never got to see what we\u2019re doing now. Never got to even have a notion of that. And you know, I find that difficult.\u201d Traveller initially made little headway on mainstream country radio. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t singles-based,\u201d Stapleton says. \u201cWe were just going to play shows on it, and that was unusual.\u201d But then came the 2015 Country Music Association Awards. A 37-year-old Stapleton took to the stage with Morgane and Justin Timberlake for a performance of Stapleton\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey and Timberlake\u2019s Drink You Away. Stapleton\u2019s soulful crooning and brooding stage presence were electric, and the audience were stunned. The day prior, he still had a number of gigs with half-sold tickets. \u201cThe next day, they were all gone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew there was a different ballgame, for sure.\u201d Traveller re-entered the Billboard album chart at No 1, and has now sold more than 6m copies in the US. Stapleton\u2019s breakthrough came at a time when Nashville was dominated by bro-country; the upbeat, poppy sub-genre preoccupied with trucks, women, beer and partying, sung by young men in double denim. Labels and listeners longed for something fresh, and Stapleton\u2019s music \u2013 a cocktail of rock, Americana, bluegrass, R&amp;B and soul, with a rare vulnerability in his lyrics and a raw expressiveness in his voice \u2013 was what everyone was looking for, as was his look: part biker, part throwback to the outlaw country stars of the 70s. He believes the essence of country music is \u201cstories\u201d, and the Grammy-winning You Should Probably Leave is one example of his own talent in that regard: as two former lovers try and fail to resist temptation, the song crackles with shame and erotic tension. Stapleton became that rare thing: a crossover country superstar. Ed Sheeran and Adele called on him as a collaborator. Bus-loads of tourists began arriving outside his house in Nashville twice a day (\u201cthat felt a little unnerving\u201d), while one fan drove two states over \u201cand just kind of showed up in my driveway. That\u2019s a level of fandom I don\u2019t quite understand. Sometimes, if you\u2019re trying to eat lunch with your kids or something like that, maybe you don\u2019t want to be \u2018on\u2019. But that just comes with the territory.\u201d His mum is evidently more comfortable with his fame \u2013 prior to one awards ceremony, \u201cI was talking to her on the phone, and she said: \u2018Well, have fun getting your awards!\u2019 Like it was a foregone conclusion. She has an overabundance of pride.\u201d And did you win that night? \u201cProbably!\u201d he says, laughing. By 2023, a GQ headline was asking \u201cIs Chris Stapleton the one thing America could agree on?\u201d, and for all that he trades in occasionally angry and even subversive songwriting, he has cultivated universal admiration by being very even-handed. Of the pressure celebrities are under to endorse a presidential candidate, he says: \u201cI\u2019m not saying celebrities shouldn\u2019t endorse people \u2013 that\u2019s American. I also think the right to keep that private, and the right to let politicians be politicians, to let people make their own choices based on what politicians say and do \u2026 that\u2019s American, too.\u201d He pays no attention to culture wars or online discourse (\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about any of that\u201d), and amid country\u2019s recent boom in the pop charts thanks to the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Shaboozey, Dasha and more, he is welcoming to the newcomers: \u201cThe notion of drawing lines or saying you can\u2019t participate because you\u2019re not from somewhere, whatever, that doesn\u2019t interest me\u201d. He has respect for and is moved by soldiers, and \u201call kinds of public servants\u201d who \u201cdefend and protect\u201d. Asked whether country music has issues with intolerance or sexism \u2013 last year country chart-topper Maren Morris distanced herself from the scene because of its misogyny and participation in culture wars \u2013 he has a politician\u2019s non-specific condemnation: \u201cThere\u2019s intolerance and sexism everywhere \u2026 you\u2019re kidding yourself if you think those things don\u2019t exist.\u201d To Stapleton, American values are about \u201cfairness and defending those who can\u2019t defend themselves, or standing up for each other\u201d, he says. \u201cAbout coming together, understanding points of view that aren\u2019t yours. American values would be someone who grows up in the city getting to sit down and talk with somebody who didn\u2019t, like myself. And then we can still find common ground.\u201d The stakes are so high with next month\u2019s election that some might find Stapleton as evasive as the protagonist in his song White Horse. But as those tour posters suggest, he\u2019s about being red, white and blue, rather than red, white or blue. \u201cI doubt that all Americans could agree on me,\u201d he continues, referring to that GQ headline. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take it. If that\u2019s true, I think it\u2019s wonderful, because I think we need more things we can agree on.\u201d \u2022 Traveller Whiskey is available now",
