        "bodyText": "A race against time to stave off imminent eviction, with added peril due to a misunderstanding over a rare pair of Nike Air Jordan trainers, One of Them Days walks a relatively familiar buddy movie path. Dreux (Keke Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA) are best friends and roommates in a cheap and cheerful apartment in LA\u2019s Baldwin Village. But then Alyssa\u2019s feckless boyfriend spends the rent money and the women have until the end of the day to raise the cash. With its zingy colour palette and effervescent, unapologetically uneven storytelling, the film has a buoyant, almost cartoonish quality (albeit one laced with lip-smacking, sexually explicit dialogue). What elevates this raucous romp by music video director Lawrence Lamont is the crackling energy between Palmer (Nope) and singer SZA, making her acting debut here. Dreux also gets a love interest, in the shape of a mysterious hunk named Maniac (Patrick Cage). But Dreux and Alyssa, with their sparky chemistry and crisp comic sparring, is the only relationship we care about. In UK, Irish and Australian cinemas",

        "trailText": "The stars shine in bright and boisterous new buddy comedy, executive produced by Issa Rae, that only stumbles when it leans into cartoon",
        "bodyText": "I will be the first to say: I miss Insecure, which left a dynamic duo-sized hole in the TV landscape since it concluded in December 2021. Issa Rae\u2019s era-shaping series was about many things \u2013 the Black community in south Los Angeles, the diversity pablums of the 2010s, millennial dating, for starters \u2013 but at its core, it was a seminal portrait of longstanding, complex female friendship in one\u2019s late 20s, the kind forged by time, ridiculous escapades and plenty of meaty conflict for viewers to hash out at the proverbial water cooler. The shadow of the erstwhile HBO series looms large over One of Them Days, a boisterous new buddy comedy executive produced by Rae and penned by the former show writer Syreeta Singleton. Also set in south Los Angeles \u2013 albeit on one sweltering, no-good first of the month, when the rent is due and tenancy is in flux \u2013 One of Them Days, directed by the Rap Sh!t and music video veteran Lawrence Lamont, similarly concerns two wayward twentysomething besties who can, for enough moments to suffice, conjure the fizzy magic of its forerunner. Once again, two friends are at a crossroads, of sorts. Dreux (the ever charismatic and indefatigable Keke Palmer) runs a local diner with aspirations to become a franchise manager; her childhood best friend and roommate, Alyssa (the singer SZA), is an artist skeptical of the corporate path \u2013 or really, any path or structure \u2013 and ekes out a living by whatever means immediately available. Both are living paycheck to paycheck and increasingly at the whims of gentrification (in the form of their new neighbor Bethany, a textbook wide-eyed white girl knowingly played by Maude Apatow), and both are on a tight deadline: the rent is due. Dreux trusted Alyssa to pay, and Alyssa trusted the cash to her deadbeat sneakerhead boyfriend Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), who summarily beat it. In lively, mile-a-minute fashion, the two find themselves on a quest with an on-screen countdown: recover the cash, get Dreux to her corporate interview by 4pm, and pay their unsympathetic landlord Uche (Rizi Timane) by 6, lest they get evicted. Hijinks ensue, which \u2013 despite a trailer that leaned heavily on the film\u2019s most outrageous moments, too high-voltage (literally) in the moment and especially so out of context \u2013 are generally grounded and frequently funny. That\u2019s largely due to the two leads, particularly Palmer, whose natural gravity and distinct delivery \u2013 rapid-fire, jazzy, zagging where one would zig \u2013 makes even the most flat material sing. Palmer received long overdue prestige recognition for her dramatic (though, being Palmer, never not sparkling) turn in Jordan Peele\u2019s Nope; back in solidly comedic territory, she makes playing Dreux, a Keke-esque hustler under different circumstances, seem like a breeze. SZA, in her acting debut, is comparatively stiffer though equally melodic, especially when the two friends get going \u2013 their rat-a-tat banter is the best part of the movie. She\u2019s admittedly saddled with the less sympathetic character. Insecure mastered the balance in the friendship rifts, where both participants are equally right and wrong; in this case \u2013 and perhaps others feel differently, though I am usually the less planned half of my friendships \u2013 Alyssa is mostly at fault, at times distractingly callous and capable of unintentional sabotage. Alyssa\u2019s self-absorption may be harder to swallow, but Palmer and SZA enjoyably ham up what could otherwise be try-hard, too gimmicky fare \u2013 a stint at a payday loan with a snarky lender (Keyla Monterroso Mejia), a fight with Keyshawn\u2019s vengeful new girl (Aziza Scott). Some of the bits, such as a messy episode at a blood bank with an incompetent nurse (Abbott Elementary\u2019s Janelle James) or a snafu with a gun-wielding neighborhood menace (Amin Joseph), go too far, or lean too cartoonish to land, a level 11 when level 10 would suffice. It\u2019s a bumpy ride, albeit an overall enjoyable one, with a believably character-populated apartment community and unforced, consistent energy. As Dreux notes in a meta-point at her (predictably unpredictable) job interview, chances like this don\u2019t come for people like her that often. For the still too-rare, Black-led female theatrical comedy, One of Them Days has a tendency for overkill, but makes its moment count. One of Them Days is out in the US on 17 January with a UK date to be announced",

        "trailText": "Global chart dominated by US acts including Benson Boone, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Sabrina Carpenter, with K-pop bands also strong",
        "bodyText": "British pop stars have failed to reach the worldwide annual charts of the year\u2019s Top 10 biggest singles and albums for the first time in more than two decades. In 2022, UK acts such as Harry Styles and Glass Animals made up seven of the 20 entries in the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) list. This year, the leading UK act was producer and singer Artemas, for I Like the Way You Kiss Me. British stars such as Charli xcx \u2013 arguably the most conversation-dominating UK act of 2024, with her album Brat \u2013 Dua Lipa and Coldplay did not feature. It is the first time since 2003 that a UK act hasn\u2019t featured in either the singles or albums list. The No 1 song globally was Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, and the No 1 album globally was The Tortured Poets Department by Taylor Swift. K-pop boybands dominated the albums list, with two entries from Seventeen (Spill the Feels at No 6 and 17 Is Right Here at No 8), along with Enhypen (Romance: Untold at No 4) and Stray Kids (ATE at No 10). The remainder of the list came from US superstars: Hit Me Hard and Soft by Billie Eilish (No 2), Short n\u2019 Sweet by Sabrina Carpenter (No 3), SOS by SZA (No 5), One Thing at a Time by Morgan Wallen (No 7) and Stick Season by Noah Kahan (No 9). In the singles chart, only Irish songwriter Hozier, with Too Sweet at No 6, deviated from the otherwise total US dominance of the list, which spanned pop (Carpenter\u2019s Espresso at No 2) to rap-country (Post Malone and Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help at No 7) and a five-year-old song by Swift, Cruel Summer, at No 9. The insistence of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s blockbuster Drake diss track, Not Like Us, was confirmed as it appeared at No 8. Jo Twist, chief executive of British record industry body the BPI, told the BBC: \u201cBritish artists may have enjoyed stronger years on the international stage, which perhaps isn\u2019t surprising given some of our biggest names were not in cycle in 2024. \u201cThere was still plenty to be excited about, as a new generation announced itself \u2013 not least Charli xcx, who enjoyed a breakthrough year globally, alongside international chart success for emerging artists such as Jordan Adetunji, Artemas and Good Neighbours, while the likes of Lola Young and Myles Smith are now rapidly building an international following.\u201d Twist said that it is \u201cundoubtedly becoming much harder to break talent in a hyper-competitive global music economy\u201d. The news comes ahead of the Brit awards this weekend, led by xcx with five nominations for Brat, followed by Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith with four.

The Guardian will cover the half-time show in our Everything but the Football live blog. Several ad spots, including a Squarespace ad featuring Barry Keoghan (and a donkey), Glen Powell for Ram Trucks, and Catherine O\u2019Hara and Willem Dafoe for Michelob Ultra, are already available to stream. Andy Reid, head coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, stars in an ad for Skechers as well. Who performed the national anthem?

        "trailText": "While the game goes ahead, it\u2019s a big night for culture with a much-anticipated half-time show, a string of big name ads and a returning role for Taylor Swift",
        "bodyText": "So Taylor\u2019s boyfriend didn\u2019t win this year, that much we know (Taylor, on the receiving end of some pretty juvenile boos, didn\u2019t seem to have the greatest of nights this time around) but he wasn\u2019t the night\u2019s biggest loser \u2013 that would be Drake. The Canadian rapper has been on the receiving end of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s ridicule for months now, and tonight we got to see the perfect finale, the Grammy-winning diss track Not Like Us performed for America\u2019s biggest TV audience of the year. It was the most obvious crowd-pleasing moment of a mostly unconventional set, avoiding bigger songs and relying on social commentary, via Samuel L Jackson, that challenged an audience accustomed to an easy ride. The ads of the night were starrier than usual, as was the stadium itself, but there was also an unpleasant amount of both AI spots and those that were not exactly political but were patriotic in an old-fashioned way that felt prioritised at the expense of anything more progressive (No gays! No trans! Just one mention of climate change!). It tracked that it was the year that Trump turned up. At least he got to see Kendrick Lamar perform. F1 The big Super Bowl spot for Brad Pitt\u2019s F1, one of the summer\u2019s biggest question marks, continues the good work done by last year\u2019s first trailer, focusing on multi-sense immersion. It\u2019s set to be the most authentic racing film we\u2019ve ever seen, made in collaboration with the governing body behind Formula One and filmed during actual events over the last couple of years, and the stripped-back new ad highlights such authenticity. Hopes are high with a giant budget and backers Apple still waiting for their first genuine box office hit but if anyone can make this kind of unlikely magic happen, it\u2019s Joseph Kosinski, who also steered Top Gun: Maverick from curio to blockbuster. Smurfs In year that\u2019s lazily bringing back more franchises than ever before from Jurassic World to Final Destination to 28 Days Later to How to Train Your Dragon, why not try once again to make Smurfs work? The characters have moved from Sony to Paramount after two connected films and one reboot and all bets have now been placed on Rihanna as Smurfette, following in the footsteps of Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. After all that wait, is the new Rihanna album going to be a Smurfs soundtrack? The next chapter in the story of soda A wildly ambitious ad here from Poppi, that slightly more expensive and substantially less tasty alternative to regular soda. According to the voiceover, Poppi is what what your kids will think of when they think of soda! Poppi is the next chapter in the story of soda! It\u2019s enough to scare one into actually drinking Poppi. Super Bowl ads always lean patriotic \u2013 Budweiser Clydesdales, etc \u2013 but this year had an especially awkward edge. The current political divide is stark, and the president who is currently attempting to dismantle much of the government was in attendance tonight. And yet many of the ads and game promos, starring A-list celebrities such as Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, blithely championed American iconography: freedom, flags, the open range and, of course, football. That\u2019s the job, but especially absent any topics considered \u201cwoke\u201d (Kendrick\u2019s half-time show notwithstanding), the disconnect was striking. Carl\u2019s Jr brings back bikinis Eight years after ditching the strategy of using models in bikinis to sell their burgers, Carl\u2019s Jr returns with TikTok influencer Alix Earle doing just that. Well, tonight was not the romcom sequel for Taylor Swift. You do not need to understand football to know that Travis Kelce\u2019s team didn\u2019t play well. No shots of Taylor cheering during a pivotal moment. The Chiefs, and TNT, were never underdogs, but didn\u2019t even have the semblance of being underdogs this year, and popular sentiment was solidly in favor of the other team. Taylor even got some boos when she appeared on the jumbotron: She did get some support from Serena Williams, though. And she will be fine, of course. Andy Reid\u2019s side hustle Andy Reid, leader of the Kansas City Chiefs, is making a play to fill the void of America\u2019s favorite NFL coach left by \u2026 no one \u2026 with this riff on the side hustle. First it was Zoolander-esque hand-modeling \u2013 the better to show off what three Super Bowl rings you have \u2013 and now it is Skechers no hands slide-ons. Here\u2019s Sam Wolfson\u2019s great four-star review of tonight\u2019s half-time show: Novocaine As audiences prefer to stick with known quantities like Keanu Reeves, Gerard Butler and Jason Statham, Hollywood continues to try out new action stars with mostly middling results. Aaron Taylor-Johnson couldn\u2019t get anyone craving some Kraven the Hunter, Henry Cavill scored two flops back-to-back with Argylle and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, and this weekend, Ke Huy Quan\u2019s first leading vehicle Love Hurts went nowhere for nobody all at once (it opened to a pitiful $5.8m). Will they warm to Ana de Armas in John Wick summer spinoff Ballerina or maybe Jack Quaid, best known for Amazon\u2019s The Boys and last month\u2019s Companion, in gimmicky caper Novocaine? He plays a man incapable of feeling pain whose girlfriend is kidnapped. Given the pricey placement of this new tease, it\u2019s clear that Paramount is hoping for big things from a film that looks like it has a very small budget. All said and done, Kendrick\u2019s \u201cHey Drake\u201d impish grin is definitely the meme of the night. Some highlights from what remains of the site formerly known as Twitter: Cher turns back time for Uber Eats Uber would like you to know that they too know the memes on Cher not aging \u2013 in another budget-flex ad clearly inspired by one of the greatest ever Twitter (never X) threads, Cher uses her powers of timelessness/Uber Eats to turn back time \u2026 to the era of witch trials. Walton Goggins\u2019s AI goggle glasses Walton Goggins is the latest celebrity to hop on the AI endorsement train, for GoDaddy\u2019s Airo, a generative AI service for small businesses. Lol that the ad compares AI\u2019s ability to produce things you don\u2019t know how to make \u2013 like a logo for Walton Goggins\u2019s goggle glasses \u2013 to the skills of \u2026 a human actor. I think you should eat The internet\u2019s favorite IYKYK comedians Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson bring their signature absurd comedy of manners to this Totino\u2019s Pizza Rolls spot that is basically an IYKYK ad for Robinson\u2019s Netflix series I Think You Should Leave. I am personally delighted to see what deranged platitudes they can deliver in under 10 seconds. There\u2019s also some footage of the guy who was tackled and removed during the performance after he rushed onto the field with a Palestine flag: Here\u2019s the full half-time performance if you missed it: Muppets on vacation No one has quite figured out what to do with the Muppets ever since they returned in 2010\u2019s rather wonderful movie. There was a middling sequel, a one-season ABC series and a one-season Disney+ series, the characters currently stuck in Disney\u2019a vault until someone else reboots them. They\u2019ve been let out for a brief appearance in this Booking.com ad, their umpteenth Super Bowl ad that, as has become standard, doesn\u2019t really know what to do with them. Dove goes for body positivity In a spot aiming for serious and sentimental, Dove makes another case for changing the way we talk to girls about their bodies, comparing the joy a three-year-old finds in running to the self-hatred a 14-year-old feels about her legs. No product, just a call to treat girls better, becauseone in two who quit sports are criticized for their bodies. Oof. David Beckham\u2019s long-lost brother? In an ad clearly going for the \u201cmost cinematic\u201d award of the night, David Beckham learns he has a long-lost brother, whom his parents named \u201cOther David\u201d. Enter Matt Damon, playing Other David, and the pair bond over a pint, \u201csoccer\u201d (meaning \u201cfootball\u201d) and requisite Ben Affleck ribbing. In surround sound: Harrison Ford waxes poetic for Jeep Wow, Harrison Ford is really feeling his Yellowstone era (he stars in 1923). The actor appears, mug in hand, in a lodge by the mountains, in stoic main character mode for a video essay on the importance of writing your own story, life\u2019s owner\u2019s manuals and freedom, etc. Some shots of American soldiers and the beautiful Rockies gives an extra layer of weird patriotism to this rambling Jeep ad, one of several weirdly patriotic spots tonight. A serious note for climate change A break from things to buy with a spot on something more pressing: climate change. The ad, from a group from Science Moms and the Potential Energy Coalition, is blunt on the point that we\u2019re running out of time to make necessary changes for the climate, and to give our children the world we promised. The ad apparently only aired in LA and on streaming, but will still presumably reach millions, along with all that AI promo. Is there any celebrity who isn\u2019t there tonight? Apart from Drake ofc: One of the best SNL Super Bowl skits imagined a world where the half-time guest cancelled at the last minute and was replaced by Broadway musical theatre actors. Cue horror: Stop enjoying those mozzarella sticks It\u2019s time to back away from the snacks thanks to a rollercoaster ad here from telehealth company Hims and Hers. First we\u2019re scared \u2013 obesity is a deadly epidemic that kills millions - then we\u2019re angry \u2013 there\u2019s a $160bn industry that profits from urging us to lose weight \u2013 then we\u2019re relieved \u2013 the answer lies with, you got this, Hims and Hers and a range of effective but, wait, still not exactly free medications. Now we\u2019re hungry again. Still hung up on Not Like Us over here, the second of two Drake diss tracks (the other being Euphoria) that Kendrick performed to the largest audience of his career. Interestingly, Kendrick made some adjustments to the lyrics for the broadcast \u2013 he notably skipped over the word \u201cpedophile\u201d (the center of Drake\u2019s defamation lawsuit against UMG), but did get the whole crowd in for \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d. And, well, he said this. Not a good night for Drake: The Bud Light boys are back Bud Light smartly recruited the two most Bud Light-y of celebrities \u2013 longtime rep Post \u201cSolo cup on stage\u201d Malone and comedian Shane \u201chold my beer\u201d Gillis \u2013 for this year\u2019s spot, fittingly set in an archetypical suburban cul-de-sac. The message? Bud Light lets dudes be dudes. Somehow this successfully toes the line between \u201cAmerica, fuck yeah!\u201d and \u201cactually could be fun\u201d. H\u00e4agen-Dazs slows it down Fast and Furious fam Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris slow down thanks to the smooth jams of Smokey Robinson and an ice-cream bar. There are shades of a 2000s-era Viagra commercial thanks to the mood music, Pacific Coast Highway locale and vintage car. Kieran Culkin is baby beluga Kieran Culkin, the former Succession star on the awards circuit this year for playing a very Kieran Culkin character, appears here as a very Kieran Culkin character who is also a financially savvy beluga whale. I think this counts as part of the Oscar campaign? Go away, Doja Cat In a year that\u2019s more stuffed with celebrity ads than usual, a rather funny use here of a rather funny Doja Cat forcing her way into Taco Bell\u2019s celebrity-free Super Bowl ad. Get her on SNL! Jurassic World: Rebirth While the Jurassic World movies might have failed to reach the lofty heights of Jurassic Park, I\u2019d argue they were mostly more successful than the two films that followed it. That, some hard-to-shake nostalgia and the pairing of Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali make it difficult not to get just a bit excited about the still completely unnecessary Jurassic World: Rebirth. The new spot is essentially a remix of the recent trailer but then that was a remix of everything that came before anyway. It appears that someone briefly crashed Kendrick\u2019s performance with a Palestinian flag with the words Sudan and Gaza written on it, even getting on the set\u2019s GNX car. According to Guardian sports editor Bryan Graham, who is at the game, the person waved the flag for about 45 seconds before security guards tackled them. Tipsy on sugar Shaboozey might not have won any Grammy awards for his monster hit Tipsy but he did get the chance to sing It\u2019s a Wonderful World in a Super Bowl ad for Nerds gummy clusters, so every cloud \u2026 Kendrick really will not give Drake a break, even taking a fresh swipe at him during the show. \u201cI want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,\u201d he said during one tease of Not Like Us, referring to Drake\u2019s defamation lawsuit over the track. Even abridged and censored, the song was still an astonishing W for the rap beef. Even rumored former Drake paramour Serena Williams was on stage for the occasion. Naturally, it also lit up the internet. Nate Bargatze balls out for DoorDash Nate Bargatze is on a roll \u2013 after hosting Saturday Night Live for the second time this fall, and thus being one of the more famous standup comics in America, he\u2019s now applying his dry humor to a Super Bowl ad in support of DoorDash\u2019s rewards program. My main question is: where did he get this Met Gala-worthy robe? Matthew McConaughey vouches for good AI Another commercial break, another celebrity vouching for some version of AI \u2013 in this case, Matthew McConaughey gets stranded in the rain because his booking app doesn\u2019t use Salesforce\u2019s AI assistant Agentforce, while Woody Harrelson has a nice dry meal. An attempt to assuage fears with folksiness, as McConaughey assures it\u2019s \u201cwhat AI was meant to be\u201d. Also if Samuel L Jackson turning up wasn\u2019t enough of a surprise\u2026 And here are some closer looks at Kendrick\u2019s show-stopping performance (with guests): Was it just me, or did that show feel like it flew by? Kendrick ends on a high note with a shoutout to Compton and his collaborator, Mustard, for the GNX track tv off. Kendrick and was confident and in command throughout, SZA sounded amazing, the act was a political statement in its existence \u2013 a solid Super Bowl half-time show. Here\u2019s that moment: Oh, he\u2019s really teasing and dragging out the intro to Not Like Us, this must feel good. \u201cThey tried to rig the game but you can\u2019t fake influence,\u201d he says before launching into the hit of last year. Well, it happened. We heard \u201chey Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young\u201d at the Super Bowl, along with tens of thousands trilling \u201cA minorrrrrr\u201d. Kendrick is bouncing between the eras \u2013 Damn, GNX (he teases Not Like Us, but not yet!), then slows it down with SZA for Luther and their Black Panther hit All the Stars. All smooth and mesmerizing so far. Oh hell yeah, Jackson once again appears to mock so many criticisms of rap music \u2013 \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto\u201d \u2013 before Kendrick goes into Humble, with his red, white and blue dancers forming an American flag of Black faces. That\u2019s quite an image. Alright, alright, Kendrick is here. Samuel \u201cUncle Sam\u201d Jackson introduces the one and only Kendrick, who starts a cappella on a GNX before he brings out a team of coordinated dancers and a statement \u2013 \u201cThe revolution about to be televised, you picked the right time but the wrong guy\u201d \u2013 before launching into Squabble UP. Let\u2019s goooooo. OK, we\u2019re minutes away from Kendrick\u2019s half-time show, and we can see behind the commentators that a GNX is now at midfield, the platform is being wiped down, the smoke is billowing, the lights are going down \u2026 almost go time! If there\u2019s any remaining doubt about whether Kendrick\u2019s going to perform Not Like Us in a few minutes: they cranked it up for the crowd while the stage crew set up for his show \u2026 With the statement released, Drake is as far away as possible (Australia) wearing \u2026 this (swipe for the boots): Drake has spoken! Ahead of Kendrick\u2019s half-time performance, in which he will almost certainly sing his Drake diss track to a 100-plus million people, the Canadian rapper released a statement doubling down on his claim of defamation: For reference, Drake has sued his and Kendrick\u2019s label, Universal Music Group \u2013 not Kendrick himself \u2013 accusing the company or prioritizing profits, for a hit song calling him a pedophile, over the truth/his mental health. Welcome to Magic Mike\u2019s Wrexham St\u014dk Cold Brew\u2019s first Super Bowl ad (is this the go-to grocery store coffee now?), invokes the power of franchise brands: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s Wrexham football club and, more entertainingly, Magic Mike. Good to know Channing Tatum\u2019s still game and still got it. Nike convenes the female all-stars This one\u2019s for the girls! Nike recruits a stacked roster \u2013 Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Caitlin Clark and Jordan Chiles, among others \u2013 for a spot roasting all the criticisms people will lob at female athletes. Such as: you can\u2019t be too ambitious, fill a stadium, be too emotional, etc. Some sick shots of Chiles doing gymnastics. Co-signing and cc-ing Hellmann\u2019s: Glen Powell\u2019s pickup truck fairytale Glen Powell, a proud Texan and one of Hollywood\u2019s It boys, appeals to his base: women and men who love trucks (especially the Dodge Ram). Powell is so game for anything that this revisionist fairytale of a man and his three bear-ish trucks is actually pretty charming. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s gig as the half-time show performer arrives at an unprecedentedly great time for the Compton-bred rapper, and a very bad time for Drake. The two stars\u2019 rap beef last year lit up the charts and the culture; last week, Kendrick stomped the nail in the coffin by winning not one but five Grammys for his diss track Not Like Us, a masterpiece of studied hater energy. I will not soon forget the image of Kendrick accepting his song of the year award as the crowd trilled \u201cA minorrrrrr\u201d. It only gets worse for Drake, because it\u2019s likely a stadium full of people will sing that line tonight. There\u2019s almost no way Kendrick, who guested during Dr Dre\u2019s half-time hip-hop bonanza three years ago, will leave the summer smash off the setlist. As for what else to expect \u2026 Collaborator SZA is confirmed to make an appearance. And in a rare interview with Apple Music, Kendrick promised \u201cstorytelling\u201d \u2013 be that on Drake or, more likely, in support of Compton and Black America, we shall have to wait and see. A horse walks into a bar Super Bowl regulars Budweiser here to teach us that every young horse\u2019s childhood dream is to help people drink cheap watery beer. Inspiring! Pringles makes moustaches fly Another ad with flying facial hair? The always welcome Adam Brody sounds the empty Pringles can alarm, accidentally transforming many a famous moustache (Nick Offerman, Andy Reid) into a disconcerting facial hair moth-like thing. When Harry Met Hellman\u2019s A \u201chow have they not done this yet?\u201d moment from Hellman\u2019s, in which Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal revive the famous Katz\u2019s deli scene from When Harry Met Sally. Sydney Sweeney steps in for the role of the \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having\u201d granny. So that reported Open AI ad for ChatGPT has aired \u2013 a simple black and white design in pointillist dots, because \u201call progress has a starting point\u201d. It frames ChatGPT as a tool for human expression, asking \u201cwhat do you want to create next?\u201d Which is \u2026 an interesting framing. Poor Kendrick getting drenched in Gatorade here by one of tonight\u2019s special guests, SZA. Impressive calm: Nestle gets tongues dancing Nestle\u2019s first-time Super Bowl spot for Coffee Mate is a now rare thing: an ad without a celebrity. At least, a visible one \u2013 an off-screen Shania Twain gets saddled with a jingle about a tongue left dancing from allegedly delicious cold foam. Cooking for aliens One of the laziest pick-up-the-cheque-and-run celebrity ads of the night has Gordon Ramsay being told he needs to cook for some foodie aliens before discovering that a) their hi-tech frying pans are in fact HexClad, a brand he already uses, and b) their leader is Pete Davidson. Worse than it sounds! It\u2019s a big day for SZA fans \u2013 earlier today, ahead of her appearance during Kendrick Lamar\u2019s half-time show, she released four new songs off Lana, the deluxe edition of her Grammy-winning album SOS. The new tracks \u2013 Joni (featuring Don Toliver), Take You Down, Open Arms (just SZA) and PSA \u2013 are basically updated version of songs that have been floating around for awhile, but still, a win for SZA fans. As a football game, the Super Bowl has stayed pretty consistent in recent years \u2013 the Chiefs versus someone. As a spectacle of American capitalism, it has ballooned. The price of a 30-second spot this year \u2013 let alone the celebrities featured in them \u2013 surpassed $8m, a new record for America\u2019s most-watched game. Pre-game ads are also busting the bank, going for a reported $4m or so. That\u2019s not the inevitable growth of inflation; just six years ago, the spots were becoming difficult to sell, the attention not seen as entirely worth the price. But the rise of diffuse streaming platforms means the rare opportunity for millions upon millions of eyeballs looking at the same thing at once \u2013 and advertisers are paying for it. Google\u2019s AI goes for the heart The night\u2019s requisite tearjerker, about a man using Google\u2019s Gemini AI voicebot to help him prep for a job interview after years off the market as a stay-at-home dad. One of the lasting images from last week\u2019s Grammys: a prolific hater salutes a fellow prolific hater, as his diss track wins song of the year. The Super Bowl is an almost assured victory lap for infamous grudge holders Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, regardless of the outcome of the game. Issa Rae does her taxes Issa Rae drives backwards down a highway to correctly point out that taxes suck and are unnecessarily confusing \u2013 the solution being TurboTax. She also gets to play \u201cis it cake?\u201d with a box of forms. Celebs celebing together: Uber Eats orders all the celebs Last year, Uber Eats reunited Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer for a Ross and Rachel-themed spot, this time it flexes that celebrity budget again with Matthew McConaughey as a conspiracy theorist who believes that football was invented to sell people food \u2013 with cameos from Kevin Bacon, Charli xcx, Martha Stewart and Greta Gerwig. Only for salty freaks Who new Ritz had such game? The saltiest cracker brand has hired the saltiest of celebrities \u2013 Aubrey Plaza and Michael Shannon \u2013 for their new Super Bowl spot, trying to outdo each other, only to be met with a very smiley Bad Bunny, breaking the rules. One of tonight\u2019s better ideas and smarter use of celebrities. Like presumably half the viewers this evening, we have eyes on Taylor Swift, who is in her private zone with Ice Spice, the Haim sisters and her family: Wearing bedazzled (lol) jean shorts with white leather boots: Making meme-ories already: And a full look at TNT\u2019s fits \u2013 she is at least true to her style with the thigh-high boots, oversized jacket and cut-off denim. Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg say no to hate Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg list reasons people hate \u2013 because you\u2019re from a different neighborhood, look different, act different, are different \u2013 in this spot that calls for people to \u201cstand up to hate\u201d. A nice message, to be sure, though quite hypocritical given that it\u2019s on behalf of the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism \u2013 a group founded by Patriots owner and noted Zionist Robert Kraft, who has blamed protests against Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza, which has killed an estimated 60,000 people, on \u201cdisinformation\u201d and conflated Palestine with Hamas. Coors has a bad case of the Mondays An ad that might make you rethink that last beer from Coors, about sloths at work the day after the Super Bowl, perhaps one of the Monday-ist Mondays of the year. Food Avengers assemble A pretty smart ad here from app Instacart that turns a standard shopping list into a range of characters storming their way to your day. There\u2019s the Jolly Green Giant, the Kool-Aid Man and even a cameo from the shirtless Old Spice guy Isaiah Mustafa, making us all feel guilty for how much of that dip we\u2019ve already eaten. Tripping on Baja Blast Here\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from this Mountain Dew ad: drink enough Baja Blast and you\u2019ll trip so hard you imagine Seal (the singer) as a seal (the marine mammal) crooning the 1995 hit and dentist office standard Kiss from a Rose \u2013 er, lime, in this case. Barry Keoghan\u2019s donkey gets a website In a cute and clever spot that capitalizes on both Irish accents and latent goodwill for all Irish donkeys, Squarespace reunites the two breakout stars of 2022\u2019s The Banshees of Inisherin: Barry Keoghan and Jenny the Donkey (justice for Jenny!). Except Jenny is actually Don Mosley the donkey, seeking a publicist and agent via his new website. A lot of futurist ads and American propaganda already this evening. And fittingly, T-Mobile has backed away from celebrities for a primetime spot touting its partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, which promises to bring satellite connections to all of the cellular dead zones in the US. Likely won\u2019t be the only ad helping out a tech billionaire this evening! Michelob\u2019s Ultra pickleball players My favorite spot of the night so far, because there is no better pair of actors to play to deceptively serious, deviously talented pickleball players than Catherina O\u2019Hara and Willem Dafoe. A delight from start to trophy finish. Thunderbolts Disney also teased its other big summer bet Thunderbolts with a 30-second version of a brand new trailer that\u2019s just been released online. \u201cThe Avengers are not coming\u201d says Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s Wario-ed Nick Fury at the start of the preview for the sorta antiheroes assemble caper (technically not true given that a new Avengers film has been given the green light) before a series of quips, explosions and an ironically used 80s pop song are trotted out to hopefully lure Deadpool fans to their local cinema this May. Meta tries distraction How should Meta distract users from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s cozy embrace of Trump, nixing of DEI programs and factchecking services on the platform, and very weird comments about masculinity? How about a Super Bowl ad for Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses, featuring Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt perusing (and destroying) Kris Jenner\u2019s art collection? Barrymore and Bloom make small talk Drew Barrymore and Orlando Bloom come together, and compare accents (how to say schedule, etc), for MSC Cruises How to Train Your Dragon Maybe one of the least necessary animated-to-live-action transfers we\u2019ve been lumped with for a while, the How to Train Your Dragon spot doesn\u2019t offer anything we didn\u2019t already expect and haven\u2019t already seen before. It feels like the original wasn\u2019t all that long ago and with the dragon looking essentially the same in both, it\u2019s a struggle to know why we\u2019re here again. Eugene Levy loses his eyebrows Little Caesars\u2019s Crazy Puffs are so eyebrow-raising delectable that they cause Eugene Levy\u2019s famously strong brows to fly right off his face like a gray, distinguished moth \u2013 which makes for images more unnerving than appealing. Lilo and Stitch Disney deserves some reluctant credit here for creating a Super Bowl ad that doesn\u2019t just resemble a condensed trailer, turning something eye-rollingly predictable (a live-action Lilo &amp; Stitch) into an advert we're actually surprised by. The 30-second spot has the once-animated, now CG monster invade the pitch, helping to kick off a campaign that will most likely make the most of all Fox and Disney channels in the next few months. Ben Affleck doubles down for Dunkin\u2019 Aaaand the first commercial of the game goes to Ben Affleck, who would like you to forget that last year he did his Dunkin\u2019 spot with one Jennifer Lopez \u2026 but not that he\u2019s forever and always from Boston. This first clip is actually part of a seven-minute short film called DunKings 2, featuring his brother Casey, former Patriots coach Bill Belichick, Belichick\u2019s 24-year-old girlfriend and Jeremy Strong, poking fun at his Serious Actor reputation. And here\u2019s that aforementioned Lady Gaga performance: Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning There are many many restarts this summer \u2013 Final Destination, Fantastic Four, Jurassic World \u2013 but there is one major end. Just don\u2019t tell Tom Cruise. What is now being marketed as the last Mission: Impossible film was once supposed to be the second part of the seventh yet underwhelming box office has changed both title and strategy with Paramount hoping, reportedly against its star\u2019s wishes, to wrap things up. This new spot pushes that selling point hard, a sad goodbye for one of the only consistently enjoyable franchises we have. She did say So High School \u2026 And one final performance from another noted New Orleans performer \u2013 Jon Batiste delivers a spirited and upbeat national anthem with a little jazz flavor, accompanied by a beautifully painted piano and, naturally (because America), fighter jets. Still rolling through the music performances prior to kickoff \u2013 Trombone Shorty and contemporary Christian singer Lauren Daigle, both natives of Louisiana, perform a jazzy version of America the Beautiful. Much more successful than Fergie\u2019s infamously jazzy national anthem. An especially star-studded Super Bowl this year! Missouri native Jon Hamm introduces the Kansas City Chiefs and noted Philly fan Bradley Cooper brings in his hometown Philadelphia Eagles. And that\u2019s it from us on the teams in this game! More celebs! In fact, more celebs than usual at the Super Bowl? Here\u2019s that very patriotic Brad Pitt ad: Now we\u2019re on to a musical celebration of New Orleans, from jazz to hip-hop, marching big brass bands to bounce, featuring Harry Connick, Jr (and the voice of New Orleans cultural icon Big Freedia). A hype way to start the evening, and convincing that New Orleans is a premiere US city for live music. On a pure name recognition level, the two most famous people in attendance tonight are Taylor Swift and Donald Trump. One very much wants to be associated with the other, and one would love to have her name out of his mouth. A brief rundown of their terse relations: Trump, you may recall, published an AI-generated fake endorsement from Swift last summer. The singer \u2013 who avoided politics entirely until 2018 and remains loath to make a statement \u2013 then supported Kamala Harris with a very Taylor Instagram post calling out said fake endorsement. Trump then posted on Truth Social: \u201cI HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.\u201d So I would not expect them to interact tonight, nor would I want to see it. A pre-recorded video paying tribute to the resilience and community of New Orleans in the face of the recent tragic truck attack in January. Lady Gaga, all in white, is performing an emotional performance of her Top Gun: Maverick theme to a crowd of locals and some football celebrities. It\u2019s a smart way to nod to recent events and provide a rousing kickoff to tonight\u2019s events. Video to come soon \u2026 Brad Pitt is making sure you know that football is culture. The actor just showed up in a PSA for \u2026 the Super Bowl? That was essentially a rambling collage of American propaganda. Appearing in New Orleans \u2013 an interesting choice, given the many issues with homes his foundation built there post-Katrina \u2013 Pitt waxes poetic on the football huddle as \u201ca metaphor for our history\u201d along with many platitudes on American unity, for a game Donald Trump is attending. Planes, trains and Oikos A planes, trains and automobiles theme from Dannon\u2019s Oikos Greek yoghurt: Juno Temple carries Cleveland Browns defensive end Miles Garrett on her back through a busy terminal so he can catch his plane on time. Remember when Super Bowl advertisers tried very hard to convince people to buy into crypto? (Tom Brady would love you to forget.) Or the year with weird Scientology ads? This year, the mainstream normalization push is for AI. Several companies, including Google, Meta and Salesforce, will have spots touting their AI ventures. And OpenAI, makers of ChatGPT, will purportedly have their first Big Game ad, assumedly to make generative AI seem less scary to the average American consumer. We just had a pretty stirring performance from Ledisi of Lift Every Voice and Sing. Given the NFL\u2019s decision to remove the \u201cEND RACISM\u201d logos from the end zones, it\u2019s somewhat surprising the league kept on with the song \u2013 one of their big concessions to come out of Colin Kaepernick kneeling to bring awareness to social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. Kendrick vs Drake! Taylor vs Trump! That team vs that other team! Here\u2019s a look at what you can expect from tonight: Spotted: one Taylor Swift. Outfit judgment forthcoming. Ahead of the game, in the latest move of what is shaping up to be the greatest Oscar campaign in recent memory, Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet managed to get in a car with Kendrick Lamar to talk shop. And be a fan boy, of course. Full clip below: There are multiple non-football celebrities already in attendance, close-ish the normies. More to come \u2026 Kendrick gave a rare interview this week with Apple Music if you want to look for some clues of what to expect from tonight\u2019s performance: It\u2019s that time of year once again for our sports brethren to focus on the big game and for us to focus on everything else. The Super Bowl is of course primarily about football, but for us it\u2019s about the culture surrounding it. This year will see a more star-packed bundle of expensive ads than ever before with celebrities such as Charli xcx and Ben Affleck, the re-appearance of Taylor Swift and whichever big-name friends she brings along, and, most importantly, recent Grammy winner Kendrick Lamar taking over the half-time show. It\u2019s set to be an exciting night for many Americans and a hellish night for one Canadian (will Lamar perform his controversial Drake diss track to the biggest crowd of his life?) and we will be here to cover every little non-sport moment of the night, so stay tuned.",

        "headline": "Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl half-time show review \u2013 game over for Drake",
        "trailText": "The Pulitzer prize-winning rapper chose artistry over more obvious showmanship in an unusual set yet still delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis",
        "bodyText": "The Super Bowl half-time show is Plato\u2019s perfect form of pomp and ceremony, a corporate-sponsored, highly choreographed musical performance used to entice people who don\u2019t follow the NFL into watching TV in order to secure even higher ad fees from Doritos and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Over the years it has provided moments of great spectacle: Prince playing Purple Rain in the rain, Rihanna announcing her pregnancy flanked by hundreds of sperm-looking dancers in duvet drip \u2013 but it\u2019s never been a site of serious artistry. Its biggest controversies \u2013 Janet Jackson\u2019s nip slip, MIA\u2019s middle finger \u2013 have been teenage in their puerility. Could that change with the arrival to the Super Bowl stage of Lamar, one of this decade\u2019s great public intellectuals \u2013 a Pulitzer prize-winning rapper who has transformed the possibilities of hip-hop? It\u2019s an unlikely match for the NFL in an ordinary year, but performing in front of a president who has attacked intellectualism, Black activism and the communities in which Lamar was raised, it felt momentous before it even began. But Lamar was not necessarily looking to make a statement. He\u2019s in the most mischievous part of his career and at the crest of his mainstream popularity: in 2024 he released a series of dueling diss tracks with Drake, which culminated in Not Like Us \u2013 a song that spent the summer atop the Billboard 200 and repeatedly and specifically calls Drake a paedophile. It\u2019s a joyous song of defiance, but one with a churlish undertone that doesn\u2019t fit with the Super Bowl\u2019s inclusivity. So which Kendrick would be arriving in New Orleans? The prophet or the provocateur? In the end we got flavours of both, with an uneven but ambitious set that was arguably the most esoteric in the Super Bowl\u2019s history, perhaps at the expense of landing a knockout blow. It began with Samuel L Jackson as Uncle Sam, playing the American machine that berated Lamar: \u201cIt\u2019s your Uncle Sam, and this is the great American game!\u201d Lamar began the show atop a 1987 Buick Grand National GNX, the rare car for which his album is named. He performed an unreleased and unnamed track, known on the Kendrick Lamar subreddit as Bodies, an early sign that he wasn\u2019t in New Orleans to play crowd pleasers. His outfit also spoke to a sense of self-possession: he wore a varsity jacket by the British designer Martine Rose and the most incredible pair of boot cut jeans \u2013 something straight off the rack from mid-00s American Eagle. The set warmed up with Squabble Up and Humble as dancers flooded the stage dressed in red, white and blue tracksuits, a nod both to the Americana of the occasion and potentially a moment of unity between Compton\u2019s two rival gangs. When the all-Black dance cast started to interplay to form the American flag, it was a moment that felt weighted with significance as Trump looked on (and was rumoured to have left shortly after). As Uncle Sam Jackson yelled at Lamar that he was \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto\u201d (perhaps in a precursor to how this set will be reviewed in red states), Lamar moved into an expansive set that resembled a tarmac Compton street corner, another impressive set that was reminiscent of Es Devlin\u2019s Compton street corner that Lamar performed on with Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Eminem at the Super Bowl two years ago. It felt at times more like a Lincoln Center play than a half-time show, with dense layered flows and an interplay of dance, Jackson\u2019s spoken-word moments and Lamar album tracks that didn\u2019t always combine to make an obvious point. Lamar is able to deploy one of the greatest flows in the history of rap, but the onslaught of complex verses didn\u2019t always work in this arena and you occasionally longed for a rousing anthem like Alright or Bitch, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe. But things changed halfway through the set when he teased Not Like Us, in a funny interplay with four female dancers. As the opening bars of the song played over the PA, Kendrick joked: \u201cI want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,\u201d a reference to Drake\u2019s ongoing defamation lawsuit against the pair\u2019s shared record label, Universal Music. In the week leading up to the Super Bowl there were some rumours that the lawsuit would prevent the song being performed. And for a moment it seemed like it might be. Instead of launching into it, he played Luther and All the Stars, his pair of songs with SZA, whose soaring vocal gave the set a more layered atmosphere and useful counterbalance. Jackson even acknowledged that these more melodic numbers would appease doubting sports fans at home: \u201cThat\u2019s what America wants \u2013 nice and calm,\u201d he shouted. But then Kendrick slammed on the brakes and swerved in the opposite direction, finally unleashing Not Like Us and it felt euphoric. He revealed a maniacal grin, looking straight down the camera as he said: \u201cHey Drake\u201d, before launching into his ruinous screed. He did tone down some of the harshest blows \u2013 self-censoring the word \u201cpaedophile\u201d, likely at both his lawyers\u2019 and censors\u2019 request \u2013 but still screeched the devastating lyric: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d, flanked by huge flags that showed small children pointing to a lower-case A. As a final jibe, Serena Williams, an ex-girlfriend of Drake, was seen crip-walking by a lamp post. The Chiefs might have been losing by 27 points at half-time, but it was Drake at that moment who was the biggest loser in North America. Kendrick himself has always seen himself more as an eyewitness than an activist \u2013 or as he put it on Family Ties: \u201cI been duckin\u2019 the social gimmicks / I been duckin\u2019 the overnight activists.\u201d This was a classy, intelligent set that chose artistry over easily meme-able moments. Instead the most obvious protest was not seen on TV but in the stadium, as someone managed to join the throng and raise a Palestinian and Sudanese flag atop Kendrick\u2019s GNX. One of the most intriguing things about Lamar is you\u2019ll never know if the protester was storming the stage or a planned part of the set.",

        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",
