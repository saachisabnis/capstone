        "bodyText": "On a sleek white stage made to look like a 1960s New York penthouse, one of pop music\u2019s biggest exponents Sabrina Carpenter is sitting on the toilet. A few seconds earlier she\u2019d wiped down the seat with a tissue before taking her spot to sing Sharpest Tool, a sweary, country-flecked bop about a hapless man who found God at his ex\u2019s house. It\u2019s a brilliantly bonkers vista that encapsulates Carpenter\u2019s ability to fuse unfiltered emotional sincerity with a heavy dose of kooky camp. Think peak era Katy Perry mixed with every era Dolly Parton. As one-third of last year\u2019s pop girl summer alongside Charli xcx\u2019s blitzkrieg agit-rave and Chappell Roan\u2019s vampy queer anthems, the 25-year-old American not only dominated the charts \u2013 her three UK No 1s from star-making sixth album Short n\u2019 Sweet spent 21 weeks at the top spot in 2024 \u2013 but she did it with a refreshing nudge and a wink. In fact, parts of tonight\u2019s innuendo-stuffed set, pitched as a 1970s variety show complete with title cards, cheesy voiceover and advert breaks, border on Carry On Carpenter. Switching to the boudoir part of the stage for the laid-back sex jam, Bed Chem, we see a silhouetted Carpenter performing overtly sexual moves with a male dancer to screams of delight from the mainly female, mainly preteen audience and shock from the accompanying parents. \u201cThere are eight-year-olds in the crowd,\u201d one mum says behind me, clearly having missed the \u201cparental discretion advised\u201d warning flashing on the big screen. Even the show\u2019s opening setup \u2013 Carpenter shown on screen in the bath apparently having forgotten she was due onstage only to appear before us wrapped in a glittery towel lined with a union jack \u2013 screams Barbara Windsor. Meanwhile, the plush roller-rink gloss of Juno concludes at the tip of a phallic runway topped off by a bulbous, deep red heart that in Carpenter\u2019s world definitely represents more than one thing. But Carpenter doesn\u2019t rely on humour as a crutch, aware perhaps that kook can easily calcify into cartoonish. The downcast Dumb &amp; Poetic excoriates a fuckboy who thinks a newfound spiritualism means all is forgiven, while Lie To Girls, which features the tiny Carpenter swamped by an acoustic guitar, turns the blame inwards: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie to girls / If they like you, they\u2019ll just lie to themselves\u201d she sings, backed by a chorus of thousands. A glorious Please Please Please, which allows Carpenter to show off her Broadway training as she locks into the intricate choreography of her dancers, is followed by the woozy comedown of Don\u2019t Smile. The show\u2019s credits start to roll. With the penthouse strewn with the bodies of passed-out dancers, Carpenter returns to add one last dose of pep. \u201cDo you fancy a cuppa?\u201d she asks, just about avoiding a British accent she\u2019d threatened all night. \u201cIt\u2019s coffee not tea, sorry,\u201d she continues as the nu-disco strut of Espresso kicks in, its nonsensical lines \u2013 \u201cI Mountain Dew it for ya\u201d \u2013 ricocheting off the walls and hitting like a gospel. As the confetti comes down, Carpenter has time to survey her disciples, some of them resplendent in Short n\u2019 Sweet football tops \u2013 number on the back? 69, obviously \u2013 while others sport hoodies emblazoned with the cheeky \u201cJesus was a Carpenter\u201d. After tonight\u2019s delirious performance, everyone should be.",

        "headline": "Reeves\u2019s Sabrina Carpenter freebie furore proves our politicians should avoid one thing: fun | Zoe Williams",
        "trailText": "With the UK mired in gloom for the foreseeable future, how can the chancellor possibly think about enjoying herself, asks Guardian columnist Zoe Williams",
        "bodyText": "The line is that Rachel Reeves had to accept Sabrina Carpenter tickets, reportedly worth \u00a3600, for security reasons. Sure, she could have bought her own tickets, but how safe would she be in a mosh pit, with her approval ratings at 58% against, 17% in favour? I would argue still pretty safe. I personally disapprove quite strongly of Reeves\u2019s performance in the exchequer: her dispiriting, intellectually shonky defeatism (for decisions, apparently, that can\u2019t be helped) and empty boosterism (for the growth she thinks she can conjure). Yet I wouldn\u2019t dream of ruining an evening of bouncy pop by accosting her, which I\u2019m sure goes for most Carpenter fans. I wouldn\u2019t even give her a piece of my mind at some musically appropriate event, like a Billy Bragg concert. Heidi Alexander started a half-hearted attempt to defend Reeves in an interview with Times Radio, which turned into an absolute knee-capping halfway through. \u201cI actually sadly haven\u2019t been to see any concerts at all over the last nine months,\u201d said the transport secretary, \u201cpartly because I\u2019ve been very, very busy.\u201d There are two counts against the chancellor. She shouldn\u2019t have accepted the tickets; the fact that she did meant she wasn\u2019t busy enough. On that second point, I\u2019m going to lodge a tiny defence. There is no right amount of busy for the chancellor to be. Any attempt to publicly exert herself in the national interest would look like a stunt, yet keeping her head down inspires no confidence. Really, the only right way to be in this situation is not-chancellor. If, for some reason, you absolutely have to be chancellor, then it is probably safest, whatever you do, never to visibly enjoy it. This strikes out any association at all with Carpenter, and even a covers band in a local pub. Let\u2019s throw in a third count against her: this error was far from forced. After the shambles of last year, with Keir and the Taylor Swift tickets (which he subsequently paid back), Keir and the \u201cdesigner\u201d glasses (it\u2019s a red flag when any politician has a \u201cdesigner\u201d anything), Reeves\u2019s own admission that before the election she\u2019d accepted a cash donation from Juliet Rosenfeld for her campaign trail wardrobe, and the endless discussions all of this sparked about whether the new government was really any different from the old, it should have been obvious that freebies are to be avoided until such time as the public has forgotten every politician who has ever been profligate in the 21st century. Nobody can say how long this will take. I think I\u2019ll be wondering what Boris Johnson\u2019s wallpaper looked like until I die. That can all be filed under \u201coptics\u201d, and should have been obvious to this political generation, who were raised to ask \u201chow will this look?\u201d first and \u201cis this important?\u201d some time later, if at all. There\u2019s a whole other vexed area, that of \u201cvibe\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s a reason why Tony Blair could ask Noel Gallagher to Downing Street and it smell like the winds of change, rather than frivolous nonsense from a prime minister who should have been concentrating on his government\u2019s minimum wage legislation. When there is optimism in the air, when people are feeling prosperous (never mind for now whether that feeling was warranted or merely a debt-fuelled mass delusion), leaders almost have a duty to echo that by visibly enjoying themselves. Contrast that with the sight of George Osborne at the London Paralympics in 2012. The former chancellor was booed by spectators because his austerity measures had already hit disabled people so hard, and the juxtaposition of him then basking in the glory of Paralympians\u2019 achievements was too much to take. But there was an underlying sense, too, that no politician, least of all the chancellor, can talk about tough choices in their day job, then throw on their chinos and enjoy the weekend. There pretty much has to be no visible enjoyment until the tough times have passed. Which is to say, even if Reeves had paid for her tickets, the news of her attending a Carpenter gig would probably still have generated opprobrium, though it might have taken a less verbal, more grunting form. Really there\u2019s no answer to this, except, no rock\u2019n\u2019roll (or country pop) until the good times are also rolling.

        "headline": "A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter review \u2013 an exceptionally good gift",
        "trailText": "She promises us the \u2018ho-ho-ho-iest\u2019 hour of all \u2026 and she delivers! The gloriously droll star brings the festive special bang up to date",
        "bodyText": "The last time I was this entertained by a Christmas special was in lockdown, when Mariah Carey waved, regally, from a sleigh, for what I remember being about seven hours. But that was four years ago and there hasn\u2019t been a decent one since. So Santa hats off to Sabrina Carpenter for coming up with a holiday special that feels entirely of the moment, right down to its starry duets, carefully curated off-the-cuff moments and internet-baiting comedy skits. Netflix has given her an unlimited budget, she says drolly, as long as she goes viral. What Carpenter has pulled together in A Nonsense Christmas is a buzzy blend of comedy sketches in the style of Saturday Night Live and duets with other pop stars who are similarly hot to go. While every production is a miracle of teamwork, the behind-the-scenes interludes suggest Carpenter has had more input than simply being moved around like a marionette. The comedy is fine, the duets are fun, but it is the Carpenter charisma that keeps it all flowing nicely. Fans will have a field day with clips of her as a toddler, asking for cake instead of Christmas presents, or gags about skimpy costumes, although newcomers may need a primer on a running joke about the ad-libbing at the end of her 2022 hit Nonsense. The tone is knowing and dry. The show is introduced with a narrative eye-roll that is maintained throughout, a tactic that pre-empts criticism. Everyone does a musical-comedy holiday special, she says. Everyone has celebrity guests. So she is doing it, too. Viewers could be anywhere, she notes, such as spending time with family or volunteering with the less fortunate. \u201cInstead, you\u2019re here, half-watching a big screen while scrolling social media on a smaller screen,\u201d she smiles. It is another bit of lighthearted self-deprecation \u2013 I\u2019m here, but I\u2019m over it, but it\u2019s good to be here \u2013 and yet she is selling herself short. The female pop titans dominating the charts this year have been a much more characterful clan than usual \u2013 and this is a clear example of that. It is hard to imagine a more bland force carrying it off. The only real joke about her megahit Espresso is a sly refusal to make a joke about it. The programme is camp, although perhaps it is unnecessary to point this out, as she opens the show by descending, like Marilyn Monroe, from a giant, red cake stand, surrounded by female dancers in dinner jackets and male dancers in vests and braces. It is occasionally bawdy, although only gently; unsurprisingly, the double-entendre potential in \u201cho ho ho\u201d is wheeled out more than once. In one sketch, she dates an older man named Nick, whom her friends (played by the Hacks star Meg Stalter and the actor Owen Thiele) quickly notice is Father Christmas (Sean Astin). She just thinks he has a dad bod, a job so dull she doesn\u2019t need to know what it is and impeccable gift-giving skills. In another, probably the best of the special, SNL\u2019s Kyle Mooney plays a generic relative, leading to a song called What Do I Get My Brother-in-Law. \u201cMaybe he likes IPAs?\u201d felt very close to the bone. The guest spots have that random, collage-like feel of social media, in which all eras and genres are up for grabs. Abbott Elementary\u2019s Quinta Brunson and Cara Delevingne appear in a rough Christmas Carol sketch, which features women who have been ghosted by \u201cEbby\u201d Scrooge (Nico Hiraga) and who teach him a lesson about staying off the naughty list. But really, everyone is here for the music \u2013 and the music is great. Some of it is taken from Carpenter\u2019s 2023 Christmas EP Fruitcake, but she also recruits famous duet partners for covers of the classics. She sings with Tyla on Donnie Hathaway\u2019s eternally popular This Christmas. Shania Twain puts in double time, playing Mrs Claus and singing Santa Baby. (In a sweet aside, you can hear Carpenter saying she can\u2019t believe Twain is there.) Kali Uchis does I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus on a rug by the fire, while Chappell Roan turns up dressed as a gift to sing Last Christmas, by the light of TV karaoke, in the aftermath of a raucous house party. Clocking in at only 50 minutes, it feels like exceptionally good value. With gags about \u201cNick\u201d being good in bed, it may not be one to put on for the kids, unless risque jokes sail over their heads. But what Carpenter promises will be the \u201cho-ho-ho-iest special of all\u201d is a spirited attempt to drag the sometimes fusty Christmas special into the modern age. \u2022 A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter is on Netflix",

        "trailText": "Melania Trump, Sabrina Carpenter and the Princess of Wales are among those turning up the volume",
        "bodyText": "It\u2019s big. It\u2019s bouncy. And it\u2019s back. From the catwalks to Capitol Hill, hair with added volume is trending. Raised at the roots and curled at the ends, big and bold hair has knocked relaxed, beachy waves off the hairstyle charts. It\u2019s the hairstyle Melania Trump loosely based her hair on for her official Flotus 2.0 portrait and it\u2019s quickly becoming the signature style for her husband\u2019s cabinet. Just days after being appointed White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt swapped her usual go-to straight and sleek look for it. Last year, Kristi Noem completed her Maga makeover with her previously short cropped hair in a shoulder-length style, alongside new teeth and fluttery fake eyelashes. This week, she posted images of herself attending her first deportation raid as homeland security secretary to X, her hair noticeably groomed and curled under a law enforcement cap. \u201cDid she go to Drybar before this,\u201d commented one user, referencing the hair salon chain that focuses on blow-drys. But Republican hair is not just being championed by Maga and Fox News anchors. Since 2011, the Princess of Wales has been styling her hair in the same way. Last March, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Super Bowl look, with her voluminised hair reaching even greater heights in front of a wind machine, led to requests in salons for \u201cTexan blowouts\u201d. On this month\u2019s news stands, Pamela Anderson appears on the cover of Elle with her blond mane blown up and out, while at this week\u2019s Copenhagen fashion week Danish showgoers who previously spearheaded neat, slick-back buns abandoned them for hair that commanded more space. Melania Trump\u2019s hairstylist, Mordechai Alvow has previously spoken about how she likes consistency with her hair. \u201cThere is a look about her where it\u2019s almost like she\u2019s the mother of the public. You want your mother to have one steady look.\u201d Elizabeth L Block, an art and cultural historian and author of Beyond Vanity: The History and Power of Hairdressing, draws comparisons between the style and Utah curls, a type of waist-length and curled hair popularised by the reality TV show The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. \u201cIn Melania Trump\u2019s new official portrait, her hair is long, smooth, and deliberately placed with one side behind her shoulder and the other side cascading along the tuxedo panel for us to admire,\u201d says Block. \u201cBut it is all very controlled. There is not a single hair out of place. No frizz. This hair takes time to achieve and money.\u201d Fatima Naveed, a senior brand manager at the London blow-dry bar Duck &amp; Dry, says \u201cbig and bouncy\u201d blowouts are the most requested look from clients. Naveed describes the style as \u201ca return to a 90s style, full of volume and root lift\u201d. At 16Arlington\u2019s spring/summer 2025 show, the hairstylist Sam McKnight used Velcro rollers and a hood dryer to give models \u201cbombshell blowouts\u201d. McKnight, who took his inspiration from 1980s Sloane Rangers and 90s supermodels, now sells a kit to emulate the look for \u00a355. Elsewhere, sales of old-school rollers are up 14% at John Lewis stores and searches for \u201cheated hair rollers\u201d up 136% online. Marks &amp; Spencer sells a pack of pink rollers for \u00a38. Following the success of its 2020 Rise hot brush that gained a cult-like following on social media, the hair tool manufacturer GHD has added two new products to its blow-dry range including a two-in-one hairdryer brush that it says delivers three times more volume than letting hair dry naturally. On TikTok, there are tutorials on how to use a sock for \u201cheatless curls\u201d. Dale Herne, a stylist at Hersheson\u2019s salon in London, credits a corresponding rise in \u201ccurtain bangs\u201d, a cut spearheaded by the pop star Sabrina Carpenter, with driving the trend. Softer than a full fringe, the cut gently frames the face and can easily be blow-dried or pin-rolled for extra volume. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful look,\u201d Herne says. \u201cIt gives you width, height and shine. Any woman with that hairstyle is going to stand with their spine a little straighter.\u201d However strong it looks, Block says \u201c[what] they all have in common is an overt femininity\u201d.",

        "bodyText": "As far as government freebies go, what gets on my nerves is the idiocy (Zoe Williams, 24 March). Accept the Taylor Swift/Sabrina Carpenter/whoever tickets. But the obvious next step is to donate the value of said freebie to a charity that people like: Shelter, Cancer Research, food banks. It\u2019s not hard for politicians to both enjoy the perks of the job and get the optics right. It\u2019s the arrogance that pisses most of us off. Kate Walker London \u2022 So Peter Kaan was nearly right: after Barney Ronay\u2019s descriptions of Arne Slot as a butcher then a greengrocer, he is now not merely a jolly baker as Kaan guessed (Letters, 25 February), but, in Ronay\u2019s latest compelling assessment, \u201cthe owner of a successful chain of provincial bakers\u201d (Alexander-Arnold\u2019s maverick talent will be missed as Liverpool near tipping point, 26 March). Mark de Brunner Burn Bridge, North Yorkshire \u2022 I\u2019ve also never been in your Birthdays column (Letters, 25 March) despite some people thinking I am, pro tem, the world\u2019s leading expert on the Victorian Turkish bath. On 30 April, when Ian Saville marks his 72nd birthday, I hope to be celebrating my 90th \u2013 so you have fewer opportunities to rectify your omission in my case.

        "headline": "Chappell, chaps, Brat or rap spats: what will \u2013 and should \u2013 win at the 2025 Grammys?",
        "trailText": "It\u2019s tough to call the quality-stacked top categories, featuring Academy darlings such as Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift alongside pop\u2019s new tyros",
        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink). Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best country solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 16 Carriages Jelly Roll \u2013 I Am Not Okay Kacey Musgraves \u2013 The Architect Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Chris Stapleton \u2013 It Takes a Woman In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "trailText": "Irish actor says people have been \u2018sitting outside\u2019 the homes of his grandmother and two-year-old son after his reported split from Sabrina Carpenter",
        "bodyText": "Barry Keoghan has deactivated his Instagram in response to the harassment of himself and his family after his reported break-up with the pop star Sabrina Carpenter, accusing fans of \u201ccrossing a line\u201d and knocking on his grandmother\u2019s door. In a lengthy statement posted on X, the Oscar-nominated Irish actor wrote: \u201cI can only sit and take so much. My name has been dragged across the internet in ways I usually don\u2019t respond to. I have to respond now because it\u2019s gettin to a place where there are too many lines being crossed. I can no longer let this stuff distract from my family and my work.\u201d The Saltburn star, who has a two-year-old son with a former partner, said he had deactivated his Instagram account after receiving messages containing \u201cabsolute lies, hatred, disgusting commentary about my appearance, character, how I am as a parent and every other inhumane thing you can imagine \u2026 Talking about how I was a heroin baby and how I grew up and dragging my dear mother into it also.\u201d Keoghan, who has been candid about his difficult childhood in foster care and the death of his mother after struggling with drug addiction, said the harassment extended to his son and grandmother, accusing people of \u201cknocking on my grannies door\u201d and \u201csitting outside my baby boy\u2019s house intimidating them. That\u2019s crossing a line.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Keoghan has called out online trolls. Speaking on Louis Theroux\u2019s podcast in November, he said: \u201cPeople love to use my son as ammunition or whatever. And it kind of leads me to stop, the more attention I\u2019ve got lately and the more in the public I\u2019ve become, the less I\u2019ve posted about my child, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to put my child online.\u201d Keoghan told Theroux that his son\u2019s absence from social media meant \u201cpeople draw a narrative and go \u2018absent father, shit, deadbeat dad\u2019 and more disgusting things I wouldn\u2019t even repeat. Just the audacity of some people, man, it sickens me and makes me furious.\u201d In his statement Keoghan, who is filming for Netflix\u2019s Peaky Blinders movie, wrote: \u201cEach and every day I work harder to push myself on every level to be the healthiest and strongest person for that boy. I want to provide opportunities for him to learn, fail and grow.

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 is out in front with the nominations for the 67th Grammy awards in what promises to be another female-heavy year. The star has scored 11 nods for her country album Cowboy Carter with recognition in the country, pop and Americana categories. It\u2019s the biggest number of nominations she has received in a single year and she now holds the joint record of most-nominated artist ever alongside her husband, Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 is also the most awarded artist in Grammys history with 32 wins, yet has not won album of the year to date. In that category she faces competition from Andr\u00e9 3000, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Jacob Collier, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift. Following Beyonc\u00e9 with seven nominations each are Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish. Then with six each is Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. Breakout star Roan continues a highly successful year and will be one of the favourites in the new artist category alongside Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, Khruangbin, Raye, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims. The record of the year category contains The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2018Em, Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso, Charli xcx \u2013 360, Kendrick Lemar \u2013 Not Like Us, Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck Babe and Taylor Swift and Post Malone \u2013 Fortnight. The song of the year category includes Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy), Billie Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019s Die with a Smile, Taylor Swift and Post Malone\u2019s Fortnight, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck Babe, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Please Please Please and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2018Em. The dance categories also saw recognition for Justice, Troye Sivan and Disclosure while the rock categories were led by The Black Keys and Green Day. The controversial star Chris Brown, who was the subject of a new documentary detailing various allegations of abuse and sexual assault, was featured prominently in the R&amp;B categories alongside Muni Long and Lucky Daye. Lamar was the most-nominated rap artist and faces competition in those categories from Eminem and J Cole. Dolly Parton, Jimmy Carter and Barbra Streisand also feature in the unusual line-up for this year\u2019s audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais are featured in the comedy album line-up. The recording academy\u2019s CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, called music a \u201cpowerful force for good\u201d in his introduction to today\u2019s announcement. The awards are voted on by a body of 13,000 members. No new categories were added for the first time in four years. Earlier this year, Taylor Swift became the first artist to win album of the year for the fourth time, taking home the award for Midnights. The 67th Grammy awards will take place on 2 February 2025 with a host for the ceremony yet to be announced.",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar ruled the Grammys during a night that also paid tribute to those affected by the California wildfires. The night\u2019s biggest prize, for album of the year, went to Beyonc\u00e9 for Cowboy Carter, the first time she has won the award. It was presented by members of the Los Angeles country fire department in one of many of the night\u2019s tributes to those affected by the wildfires. The ceremony took place at the Crypto.com arena in LA. The singer is only the fourth Black woman to win the award. \u201cIt\u2019s been many many years,\u201d she said to loud applause. A visibly shocked Beyonc\u00e9 also won for best country album, saying she \u201creally was not expecting this\u201d as she accepted the award. \u201cSometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists and I just want to encourage people to do what they\u2019re passionate about,\u201d she said. She was given the award by Taylor Swift. \u201cI will never forget standing here almost exactly 15 years ago,\u201d she said while looking back on her win in this category. Beyonc\u00e9, who also won for best country duo performance with Miley Cyrus, became the first Black woman to win a country Grammy for 50 years. Chris Stapleton took home the award for best country solo performance. Lamar won five awards for his controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us, which is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit. He took home both song and record of the year. During one of his speeches, Lamar, who is performing at next week\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, said he wanted to \u201cdedicate this one to the city\u201d. After last year saw Taylor Swift, SZA, Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish dominate, this year saw another strong female showing with Beyonc\u00e9, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Doechii and Chappell Roan winning many of the major awards. In the competitive best new artist category, Chappell Roan beat out Shaboozey, Raye, Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter. She used her speech to call on the industry to \u201coffer a livable wage and healthcare especially to emerging artists\u201d before telling the story of how she struggled to survive in her early days as a musician. \u201cLabels, we got you but do you got us?\u201d she asked. Charli xcx picked up three awards in the pop categories but lost out on pop solo performance and pop vocal album to Sabrina Carpenter. Doechii won for best rap album, becoming only the third woman to do so. Other female winners included SZA who picked up best R&amp;B song for Saturn, St Vincent who took home best alternative music album, best rock song and best alternative music performance, Kacey Musgraves who picked up best country song for The Architect and Shakira who won best Latin pop album. The Colombian singer dedicated her award to \u201call my immigrant brothers and sisters\u201d. Jimmy Carter was also a posthumous winner for the audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Chris Brown were controversial picks for comedy album and R&amp;B album respectively. Host Trevor Noah began the night by referring to the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances that have changed the tone and motivation of this year\u2019s awards. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest national disasters in American history,\u201d he said while speaking about the devastating California wildfires and calling attention to the spirit of those who have endured. To kick off the show, he introduced Dawes, a band who have lost homes and instruments as a result of the fires. They have also helped raise money for nearly 100 other families. They were joined by artists including John Legend, Sheryl Crow and St Vincent for a special performance paying tribute to Los Angeles. Noah drew attention to a number of charities and organisations, telling those in the room and viewers at home that there would be a QR code which would allow people to contribute. He later said that Amazon Music, CBS and Mastercard had donated. He also said the night would highlight local businesses affected by the fires with the venue both catered and decorated by some and with a certain amount of advertising space given to others. While presenting the award for song of the year, Diana Ross said: \u201cMay this moment remind us all of the power we hold to rebuild, to lift and to come together with compassion.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars performed a duet of California Dreamin\u2019 after a montage highlighting Californians who had lost their homes in the fires. The pair later won the best pop duo performance award for their song Die with a Smile. In her acceptance speech, she said: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d Noah had a number of jabs at the returning US president, joking that millions of immigrants were also part of this year\u2019s voting body. When speaking about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s just-announced tour, he joked: \u201cThere\u2019s tariffs, we can\u2019t afford a new tour! Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Alicia Keys was given the Dr Dre global impact award and spoke to the importance of diversity in music. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry,\u201d she said. She also added that \u201cthis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices\u201d and that \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift\u201d. Other performances throughout the night included Billie Eilish who ended her performance saying \u201cI love LA\u201d, Sabrina Carpenter who sang a rejigged and physically comedic take on her hits Espresso and Please Please Please, Chappell Roan who was introduced by Olivia Rodrigo (the Vampire singer called her \u201cmy extraordinary friend\u201d) and a surprise appearance from the Weeknd who had previously pledged a permanent boycott of the Grammys. His performance was introduced by the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who spoke about the many structural changes he had helped implement which then lured the Weeknd back. There was also a star-studded tribute to Quincy Jones who died last year. Will Smith, making his first appearance on a major televised awards ceremony since the infamous slap, called Jones \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our time\u201d in an introduction to a performance that featured Janelle Monae, Herbie Hancock, Cynthia Erivo and Stevie Wonder, who led a rendition of We Are the World with a choir wearing special LA sweaters. Smith explained that the singers represented two schools that had been lost in the fires. Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin also sang an accompaniment to this year\u2019s in memoriam section which included late stars including Liam Payne, Kris Kristofferson, Cissy Houston, Marianne Faithfull, Bob Newhart, Wayne Osmond and S\u00e9rgio Mendes. Last year saw Taylor Swift become the first artist to win album of the year four times but tonight she went home empty-handed despite six nominations. Other nominees who left without any awards included Shaboozey, Post Malone, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish.",

        "bodyText": "Charli xcx leads this year\u2019s Brit awards with five nominations for her 2024-dominating record Brat \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s album of last year. With four nominations apiece, Dua Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith are close on the pop star\u2019s trail. xcx is nominated for album, artist and song of the year \u2013 the latter for the remix of Guess featuring Billie Eilish \u2013 and in the dance and pop genre categories. But despite xcx painting the British music industry\u2019s annual party a violent shade of lime green, women remain underrepresented in this year\u2019s nominations, accounting for 34.7% of the 98 slots. Male acts comprise more than half, at 53%, with mixed-gender acts and collaborations \u2013 including the Last Dinner Party \u2013 making up the remaining 12.3%. It\u2019s a noteworthy year for some vintage groups: the Beatles\u2019 AI-abetted Now and Then is up for best song, the group\u2019s first nomination since the very first Brit awards in 1977. (Prior to becoming an annual fixture in 1983, the first Brits marked Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s silver jubilee and 100 years since the invention of the phonograph, and honoured the preceding 25 years in music, seeing the Beatles earn three nominations.) And with three nominations for Songs of a Lost World \u2013 their first album since 2008 \u2013 the Cure score their first Brit nominations in more than 30 years in the categories for album of the year, group of the year and alt/rock act. At the newer end of the scale, Stargazing singer Smith is this year\u2019s Rising Star winner, tipped by the industry for major success, and is also nominated for new artist, song and pop act. The genre categories are assembled by the Brits voting academy and then voted for by members of the public via WhatsApp. Predictably, the category for hip-hop/grime/rap act features just one woman, Little Simz, alongside Central Cee, Dave, Ghetts and Stormzy. London jazz act Ezra Collective may also be set for a breakthrough year. The five-piece released their third album, Dance, No One\u2019s Watching, in September, after winning the 2023 Mercury prize for their second album. \u201cFrom a youth club to the Brit awards and beyond,\u201d they said in a statement. Some may raise eyebrows at a group active since 2016 being up for new artist \u2013 alongside last year\u2019s Mercury winners English Teacher, the Last Dinner Party, Myles Smith and former Brit School student Rachel Chinouriri \u2013 but the category parameters stipulate that acts must have had one Top 40 album or single in the eligibility period, but can\u2019t have had a Top 10 album or more than one Top 10 single, nor have had prior nominations for best artist, group or album. Despite middling reviews for her third album Radical Optimism \u2013 which spent just 19 weeks in the UK Top 100, compared to 220 for her 2020 record Future Nostalgia \u2013 Lipa is nominated for album of the year, artist of the year, song of the year (for Training Season) and pop act. Last year\u2019s major winner, Raye \u2013 who took home six prizes in 2024 \u2013 is up for R&amp;B act. \u201cI\u2019m still processing the ridiculousness that was last year!\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to watch Charli xcx clean up this year, she just deserves it so much.\u201d Some nascent comebacks also feature: Sam Fender is up for artist of the year and alt/rock act, despite only having released two singles from his forthcoming third album, People Watching, due in February; and Jade, of the on-hiatus band Little Mix, is up for song of the year (for Angel of My Dreams) and pop act. In the international categories, Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish have two nods apiece; Eilish also clocks a third nomination alongside xcx in the song category. \u201cThank you so much for the nominations and the recognition of my art,\u201d Roan said in a statement. \u201cThe UK has always shown me so much love and championed me through these past few years. It was one of the first places that Good Luck, Babe! blew up in, so this feels extra special.\u201d The awards for producer and songwriter of the year will be announced prior to the ceremony, which takes place on 1 March at the O2 Arena in London. Returning for the first time since 2021, Jack Whitehall reclaims hosting duties. No performers have yet been announced for the night.

        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",

        "trailText": "Playing music that is as smart as it is successful, Brit winners made articulate calls for artist development \u2013 while host Jack Whitehall was brilliantly risky",
        "bodyText": "The Brits has long been in the business of underlining success; upsets and shock wins aren\u2019t really the point. If they seemed moderately more exciting in 2025 than in years past, that\u2019s partly because Jack Whitehall is a better, riskier, funnier host than anyone else offered the job in recent years \u2013 he mocked Stormzy for his promotion of McDonald\u2019s, made a joke about amyl nitrate and called Coldplay \u201cthe musical missionary position\u201d \u2013 and because 2024 was a vintage year for mainstream pop, dominated by music that was characterful and hugely successful. If Charli xcx \u2013 and producer AG Cook \u2013 hadn\u2019t been lavishly rewarded for her agenda-setting album Brat, you would have wondered what had gone wrong: likewise Chappell Roan, whose ardent emotion both in and out of the recording studio makes her one of pop\u2019s most cheering recent developments: she responded to her two awards with acceptance speeches that called upon the music industry to offer more long-term development support to artists \u2013 a theme also picked up on by Myles Smith, winner of the rising star award \u2013 and shouted out the trans community and sex workers. Cannily, the Brits managed to elbow in a third big pop name of 2024, too. The global success award was mysteriously reactivated for the first time in six years and, more mysteriously still, repurposed. Previously given to British artists who\u2019d reaped vast commercial dividends abroad \u2013 One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Adele \u2013 it went to Sabrina Carpenter, who\u2019s certainly reaped vast commercial dividends over the last 12 months, but hails from Pennsylvania. It\u2019s meant as no smear on Carpenter herself, a witty and self-knowing star whose album Short n\u2019 Sweet went to No 1 in 18 countries and contained a succession of superb, similarly chart-topping singles, but you did rather get the feeling the Brits were making up an award to give to her and \u2013 given the absence of Roan \u2013 secure her presence at the event itself. She repaid their gesture by performing Espresso with dancers dressed as Coldstream guardsmen and interpolating the song with the strains of Rule! Britannia. Among the other expected victories, Sam Fender\u2019s success came at the end of a week in which his third album entered the UK charts at No 1, selling more than 100,000 copies in the process; and Fontaines DC won international group on the back of Romance, an album that successfully managed to shift them in a more commercial direction without sacrificing any of their potency or aggression. Jade Thirlwall was rewarded for a string of solo singles that fit perfectly into the new more expansive pop zeitgeist: with its sample of Sandie Shaw\u2019s Puppet on a String and its sudden shifts in tempo and mood, Angel of My Dreams in particular was vastly more inventive and unpredictable than anything she recorded while a member of Little Mix, underlined by an episodic live performance so peculiar it stole the show. If Stormzy\u2019s victory over Central Cee in the public vote for hip-hop/grime/rap artist seemed a little surprising \u2013 as he pointed out in an acceptance speech that essentially seemed to be suggesting he didn\u2019t think he should have won, the only big hit he\u2019s recently had was from an appearance on Chase and Status\u2019s Backbone \u2013 the most striking win was Ezra Collective, and not merely because you might have expected the Cure to win best group instead (both as a nod to the success of Songs of a Lost World, their first album in 16 years, and as a kind of long-service medal). Critics have been suggesting that Ezra Collective might cross over to the mainstream for some years now, more out of hope than expectation: for all the influence they draw from hip-hop, dub, Afrobeat and dance music, they remain at heart a jazz quintet. And yet their career has recently surged. They won the Mercury prize in 2023, scored their first Top 10 album with last year\u2019s Dance, No One\u2019s Watching and became the first British jazz act to headline Wembley Arena: precisely the kind of success that the Brits should be celebrating.",

        "bodyText": "Charli xcx has won five Brit awards, including album of the year for her summer-defining, green-hued, magnificently debauched album Brat. At the ceremony in London\u2019s O2 Arena, she was also awarded British artist of the year, song of the year for Guess (featuring Billie Eilish), and one of the five genre awards, for dance act. Earlier in the week she was named songwriter of the year. The wins cap a zeitgeist-surfing year for the singer, whose knowingly trashy sound and look was so distinctive it gave rise to a whole cultural phenomenon: \u201cBrat summer\u201d, plus various things being declared \u201cbrat\u201d. It was nebulously defined \u2013 Charli asserted that the seemingly un-brat Kamala Harris was, in fact, brat \u2013 but centred around untrammelled raving, unclean living and unbothered cool. Brat topped the UK chart and has spent 38 weeks in the Top 20, and was critically acclaimed for its range: between the club bangers lay a series of thoughtful, romantic and emotionally raw tracks that laid bare Charli\u2019s anxieties about fame and potential motherhood. It was also a success in the US, reaching No 3 and winning three Grammys. She thanked some of her dance music heroes \u2013 resulting in probably the first mention of Autechre at the Brit awards \u2013 as well as Eilish for turning her contribution to Guess around in a handful of days, saying: \u201cNot all artists are [as] spontaneous, despite claiming that they are.\u201d On winning album of the year, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like an outsider ... particularly in the British music industry. So it feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven\u2019t made any sacrifices.\u201d She told her fellow artists: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to compromise your vision.\u201d The chief architect of Brat\u2019s dance-pop sound, AG Cook, won the Brit award for producer of the year. He also released a solo album during the awards\u2019 eligibility period, entitled Britpop. Charli \u2013 real name Charlotte Aitchison, 32 \u2013 first released music back in 2008, but these are her first Brit award wins following four previous nominations. Only one artist has ever won more Brits in a single year: Raye, who set the record last year with six, and who has now added to her overall haul by winning R&amp;B act for the second year in a row. Another act adding to a 2024 win was the Last Dinner Party. The flamboyant five-piece were given the rising star award last year, and have now picked up best new artist. Playing an expansive style of classic rock and alt-pop, their debut album Prelude to Ecstasy went to No 1 in February 2024, and they have become regarded as one of the UK\u2019s best live acts. Bassist Georgia Davies said they \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a band without the UK\u2019s incredible independent venues \u2013 they are the lifebood of the industry, and they are dying\u201d. She called on arena operators to financially support grassroots venues, and told artists who play the latter to \u201ckeep going, because that\u2019s the best kind of art there is\u201d. The Last Dinner Party lost out in the British group category, though, to a giantkilling underdog: jazz quintet Ezra Collective, who also beat Coldplay, the Cure and Bring Me the Horizon. Playing propulsive instrumentals influenced by Fela Kuti as well as hip-hop, funk and spiritual jazz, they are the leading light in London\u2019s recently resurgent jazz scene. Like the Last Dinner Party, their live show is hugely acclaimed, and in November they became the first British jazz act to play London\u2019s 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena. They\u2019re also the first jazz group to win a Brit award, and in 2023 they became the first jazz act to win the Mercury prize. After picking up the award, bandleader Femi Koleoso appealed for support for youth clubs and music education, saying: \u201cSo many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, we\u2019re unsure of how to fix, but the solution likes with giving a young person a trumpet, a saxophone \u2013 because when you do that you give them an aspiration, a goal.\u201d In the genre categories \u2013 which were voted for by the public \u2013 Sam Fender picked up the rock/alternative act prize for the second time, in the week he hit No 1 with his third album People Watching: the fastest-selling vinyl album by a British artist this century, and the biggest opening week for a British artist since Harry Styles in 2022. Waggishly introduced by host Jack Whitehall as \u201ca man who has put more smiles on Geordie faces than a Turkish dentist\u201d, Fender also performed his new album\u2019s title track. Former Little Mix member Jade beat Charli xcx to best pop act, having transitioned into a successful solo career with the hit single Angel of My Dreams. She adds to her three wins with Little Mix, including in 2021 when they became the first female act to win British group. She also beat Dua Lipa, who had a night to forget, not winning any of her four nominated categories. He may have won three Brits in the past and remains a commercial heavyweight, but Stormzy was something of a surprise winner in the hip-hop/grime/rap category. Central Cee had been the favourite, having become the country\u2019s most globally popular rapper in recent years (though, like Fender, his recent No 1 album Can\u2019t Rush Greatness isn\u2019t eligible until next year\u2019s Brits). As well as quoting a Bible psalm and saying he had bruised his cornea playing Padel, Stormzy namechecked Central Cee in his acceptance speech, saying that while he was grateful for the win, \u201cI don\u2019t entirely think this award should be fan-voted \u2026 sometimes I think it doesn\u2019t let people have their moments. Cench was the rap artist of the year.\u201d The public vote was between mid-January and mid-February, meaning that the outcry at Stormzy\u2019s recent McDonald\u2019s campaign did not affect his votes. This year\u2019s rising star award was given in December to singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was nominated for three further awards, including song of the year for his huge hit Stargazing, which he performed at the ceremony along with Nice to Meet You. Picking up the award, the working-class Luton musician addressed the British government: \u201cIf British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?\u201d \u201cWe have to protect the foundations that make it,\u201d he added. Like the Last Dinner Party, he appealed to arena operators to support British grassroots venues, and asked the music industry: \u201cAre we building careers, or are we just chasing moments \u2026 please stick with artists past a viral hit.\u201d It was a sentiment shared by Chappell Roan, who called for artists to \u201cnot be pressured into making music based off what is trending\u201d as she picked up the international song award for Good Luck, Babe! The US pop singer-songwriter also won the award for international artist, which she dedicated to \u201ctrans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor.\u201d Irish rockers Fontaines DC picked up international group, their second win in that category. Introduced by Diana Ross and Millie Bobby Brown, Sabrina Carpenter was given the reactivated global success award, following a year in which she had three UK No 1 singles plus a No 1 album. She thanked her British fans, saying: \u201cIn a primarily tea-drinking country, you\u2019ve streamed the shit out of Espresso \u2026 cheerio!\u201d Carpenter opened the live show to the strains of Rule, Britannia! with dancers dressed as Buckingham Palace guards, segueing into a performance of the chart-topping Espresso and then a watershed testing, raunchy rendition of Bed Chem. The show also featured performances from Jade, the Last Dinner Party, British singer Lola Young, US singer Teddy Swims, and Ezra Collective, who performed alongside London youth group Kinetika Bloco and two-time Brit winner Jorja Smith. Whitehall, who previously hosted the show between 2018 and 2021, returned with a hail of good-natured jibes targeting the likes of Simon Cowell, KSI, Coldplay (\u201cthe public school Nickelback\u201d) and even the previous day\u2019s \u201ccringe\u201d Zelenskyy-Trump meeting. He skirted the boundaries of good taste with one comment about Jade\u2019s live performance, saying: \u201cI really thought Diddy might have done it for the white party theme\u201d, and later referenced sex toys and an adult film actor \u2013 all of it casting the Brits as the award season\u2019s bawdiest, booziest event. But he also led a heartfelt in memoriam segment to Liam Payne, calling him an \u201cincredibly kind soul\u201d. Aside from the publicly voted genre categories, the Brits are voted for by the 1,338-strong Brits Academy, populated by musicians as well as industry and media figures.

        "trailText": "With nominations led by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx, the event will serve a dual-purpose by acknowledging the devastating wildfires in California",
        "bodyText": "A \u201cvery different\u201d Grammy awards will take place in Los Angeles this weekend, impacted by the recent wildfires that have affected California. The annual celebration of music, taking place at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday, will still feature a range of big-name performers but there will be a noticeable shift in purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical Grammy party atmosphere,\u201d said Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the Recording Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only \u2018the show must go on\u2019 but the show must provide a greater service. Of course, we\u2019re going to honor music, but our goal is to utilise music to make a difference.\u201d The week leading to the Grammys typically sees a string of major parties put on by record labels, but the majority have been cancelled in response to the fires, which have killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of structures. Money will instead be diverted to those in need. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\u201d Mason said. \u201cIt will honour some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d The annual tradition that will go ahead in Clive Davis\u2019s legendary gala, which takes place the night before. This year\u2019s event will also include a fundraising element. \u201cWe want to ensure that the evening will not only be a memorable night of music but will also provide impactful support for those very much in need,\u201d Davis said. This year\u2019s nominees are led by Beyonc\u00e9, whose country album Cowboy Carter brought her 11 nods, making her the most nominated artist ever alongside husband Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to win the award for album of the year and if she wins this weekend, she would be only the fourth Black woman to take it home. The star has been nominated for the award four times before. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d Jay-Z said last year on stage. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has already become the first solo Black female to top the country charts in the US and could make history if she wins in the country categories on Sunday. The singer, whose mother Tina Knowles lost a home in the fires, has donated $2.5m to relief efforts. In the category of album of the year, she faces competition from stars including Andr\u00e9 3000, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx and Taylor Swift, who won last year. Swift, who has now won 14 Grammys, has also donated to a number of wildfire funds. In an Instagram statement, urging others to also contribute, she wrote that it was \u201cheartbreaking to see the stories unfold\u201d. The singer has been confirmed to present an award on Sunday. The evening will be hosted by Trevor Noah and feature performances from multiple nominees Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter with a special tribute to the late Quincy Jones, featuring Stevie Wonder and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. \u201cIt\u2019s Grammy week,\u201d Roan wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \u201cI am very emo. My heart feels warm and fuzzy with all the support I have been given this past year. I hope you can understand that this has been incredible and scary and spiritual and confusing.\u201d The evening lands in the middle of an awards season that has seen delays and shifts as a result of the ongoing wildfires. The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and a tweaked ceremony will remove original song performances and spend more time trying to \u201cacknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires\u201d. The Critics Choice awards were also delayed until 7 February. This week also saw a benefit concert in Los Angeles with stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Joni Mitchell performing.",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight. I don\u2019t think she hates to say it at all. LS",

        "trailText": "Language experts rounded up the year\u2019s winners (losers?) in the US and UK \u2013 and provided the correct pronunciations",
        "bodyText": "At the Democratic national convention, Kamala Harris\u2019s nieces explained how to pronounce Harris\u2019s name. Chappell Roan gave fans a friendly \u201cfinal warning\u201d about the pronunciation of hers. And Zendaya settled the matter on video. All three helped to define 2024 \u2013 and spent the year hearing people get their names wrong: each appears on lists of the year\u2019s most mispronounced words in the US and UK, produced by the language-learning website Babbel, which reminds us that they\u2019re pronounced COM-a-la HAR-iss, CHAP-uhl ROHN and Zen-DAY-a. The lists, created with the closed-captioning and subtitling companies the Captioning Group and the British Institute of Verbatim Reporters, show the stars in good company: among the other mispronounced names and words are Barry Keoghan (BARR-ee key-OH-gin, with a hard g), the Irish actor and star of Saltburn, and Pete Buttigieg (Boot-Edge-Edge), the US transportation secretary. But it wasn\u2019t just humans whose names were mispronounced. Among this year\u2019s other list-makers: The Dutch Kooikerhondje (COY-ker-HUND-che), a breed of dog owned by the world\u2019s best baseball player, Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ohtani\u2019s dog won fans after \u201cthrowing\u201d the first pitch at a game (he carried the ball from the pitcher\u2019s mound to his crouching owner at home plate). Shein, the fast-fashion site \u2013 it\u2019s SHE-in, not SHEEN or SHINE. The drug in the weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy is semaglutide (sem-ah-GLOO-tide). Phryge, the mascot of the Paris Olympics and summer Paralympics, is pronounced FREE-je. It was a nod to the Phrygian cap, an emblematic accessory of the French revolutionaries. The flygskam (FLEEG-skam) \u2013 or flight-shame \u2013 movement is pushing people to cut down on flying to help the planet. Also in the word of professional sports: Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol (YOSH-ko GVAR-dee-ol) plays soccer (FOOT-ball) for Manchester City and Croatia. And the mispronunciation of the word espresso (es-PRESS-oh) as ex-PRESS-oh sparked outrage among some coffee fans. The word has been in the news thanks to the song by Sabrina Carpenter, who also made headlines for her relationship with Keoghan. Why all the mispronunciation? Blame it, in part, on the Norman invasion of 1066. English spelling is incredibly confusing thanks to the ways it has combined other languages, says Nicole Holliday, acting associate professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. On top of that, there\u2019s the linguistic \u201cinstability\u201d that comes from the democratization of news. If one person mispronounces a name in a video for their thousands of TikTok followers, it can have a knock-on effect. That\u2019s probably not so new. \u201cI imagine before TV news, there were people saying politicians\u2019 names all kinds of wild ways,\u201d having only read them in the newspaper, Holliday says. Finally, there\u2019s the phenomenon of words becoming what Holliday describes as \u201cshibboleths\u201d \u2013 in this case, words that can distinguish an in-group from an out-group. That certainly seems to be the case for Harris, whose name was mispronounced by almost half the speakers at the Republican national convention this summer \u2013 getting it wrong showed you were aligned with Donald Trump, who said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d about getting it right. But shibboleths can extend beyond politics: pronouncing your favorite celebrity\u2019s name in a certain way, for instance, might indicate that you\u2019re a real fan. Meanwhile, as with any list of words of the year, the document offers a look back, Esteban Touma, of Babbel, told the Associated Press. As Roan\u2019s music gained popularity over the year, it was an interesting cultural moment to watch as people learned to pronounce her name, he said. \u201cThe way we create understanding with each other is just trying to do these things,\u201d Touma said.

        "headline": "Saturday Night Live: star-packed 50th special brings laughs and emotion",
        "trailText": "A parade of ex cast members and celebrity hosts came together for a mammoth anniversary extravaganza celebrating the long-running comedy show",
        "bodyText": "If the 50th season of Saturday Night Live has, up until now, felt somewhat underwhelming, this past week has made up for it. It\u2019s been one celebration after another, including a star-studded live concert that aired this past Friday, a repeat of the show\u2019s very first episode during its regular Saturday-night time slot, and any number of self-produced and third-party retrospectives across the media landscape. All of it was leading up to Sunday\u2019s three-hour anniversary special. From previous specials, we knew about what to expect: the return of popular cast members, characters, sketches and guest stars; an audience of A-list celebrities; a diverse array of musical guests; and equal amounts of self-deprecation and self-mythologizing. Still, you knew there\u2019d be plenty of fun surprises and probably a good bit of emotion on display. That latter quality comes on heavy at the top of the show, with Sabrina Carpenter sharing a duet with showrunner Lorne Michael\u2019s close personal friend Paul Simon. The song they\u2019ve chosen is Simon &amp; Garfunkel\u2019s Homeward Bound, which the former previously played on Saturday Night Live, alongside George Harrison, in 1976. Carpenter gets in a funny line about how neither she nor her parents were alive then, but given how frail the 83-year-old Simon both looks and sounds, there is a real gravitas and gravity to this opening performance. Favorite recurring host and \u201cnew diversity hire\u201d Steve Martin is given the honor of delivering the opening monologue, which he regards as \u201ctypically the worst part of the show\u201d. He takes digs at SNL\u2019s age (\u201cA person born during the first season \u2026 could today be easily dead of natural causes\u201d) as well as his own (\u201cI turned 79, but I feel like I\u2019m 65 \u2026 which is also not good\u201d). He is interrupted first by former show writer John Mulaney, who pays tribute to the celebrity hosts (\u201c894 people have hosted \u2026 only two of them have committed murder\u201d), and later by best frenemy/Canadian national Martin Short, who is dragged off stage kicking and screaming by Ice agents. Martin jokes about \u201cfrontloading\u201d the monologue so that they can slack off for the rest of the show, but it\u2019s actually a pretty low-key intro. Nevertheless, Martin makes the most of it by being his funny, goofy self. The first sketch of the night has Fred Armisen\u2019s variety show host Laurence Welk introducing a musical act from horndog lounge singer Robert Goulet (Will Ferrell) and the three lovely Maharelle sisters (Anna Gasteyer, Kim Kardashian and Scarlett Johansson). But it\u2019s freakish fourth sibling Denise (Kristen Wiig) who steals both the show and Goulet\u2019s heart. A solid mashup of memorable characters from different eras of SNL. We then get a new edition of Black Jeopardy. Kenan Thompson stars as host Darnelle Hayes, while the contestants are played by Leslie Jones, Tracy Morgan and Eddie Murphy as Tracy Morgan (this reveal earns the biggest laugh so far). The running joke of the sketch is that Black people don\u2019t watch Saturday Night Live. The contestants are utterly clueless about it, even when Chris Rock shows up to remind them that he was once on it. Things do change when \u201cTracy Morgan\u201d leaves and is replaced by returning champion/Maga voter Doug (Tom Hanks). It should come as no surprise that Murphy \u2013 the greatest cast member of all time \u2013 absolutely walks away with this one. Emma Stone pops in to talk about the show\u2019s history of contrarianism, before being interrupted by the high-kicking Sally O\u2019Malley (Molly Shannon), who is also celebrating turning 50 this year. Together, they intro a video tribute to SNL\u2019s long tradition of physical comedy. The likes of Shannon, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Chris Farley and more are honored for their commitment to pratfalls, before the video wraps up with a lovely dance montage centered around the late Gilda Radner. Then, Short and Shannon return as the absolutely soused parents of newlyweds Kelsey and Matt (Chloe Fineman and Andrew Dismukes). Their reception speech devolves into a drunken make-out session, before the bridesmaids (Carpenter, alongside Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner and Sarah Sherman) perform renditions of Wicked and Taylor Swift songs about the bride\u2019s affair with \u201chung Latin guy\u201d Domingo (Marcello Hernandez), who has once again made a cuck of poor Matt. This time though, Matt\u2019s got backup in the form of his groomsmen (Bowen Yang, Kyle Mooney, Andy Samberg and Beck Bennett). Along with Carpenter, they sing a version of Espresso about Matt\u2019s own affair with Domingo\u2019s brother Renaldo (Pedro Pascal). Meanwhile, a third half-brother, Santiago (Bad Bunny), has been having sex with Kelsey\u2019s parents. I\u2019ll admit to not getting the appeal of the Domingo sketches beyond the fact that they always feature a singer with a huge fanbase on TikTok, but he is the first breakout character the show has had in ages, so it makes sense that they\u2019d give a segment over to him here. Following a brand new Deep Thought by Jack Handey \u2013 \u201cLooking back over 50 years, we treasure the laughs, the friendships, the fond memories \u2026 but the real treasure was how much money we were making\u201d \u2013 Tina Fey and Amy Poehler take center stage. The pair field questions and answers from celebrity audience members Quinta Brunson, Tim Meadows, Ryan Reynolds (who alludes to the ongoing drama between himself, wife Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni), Nate Bargatze, Jon Lovitz, wardrobe team member Donna Richards, John Lovitz, Julia Louis-Dreyfus (and her service dog), Adam Driver, Keith Richards, Zach Galifianakis, Jon Hamm, Bad Bunny, Al Sharpton, Ray Romano, Seth Meyers, Jason Momoa and Peyton Manning. An obvious excuse to milk the celebrity star power in the building and (as Meyers points out) shove in people they don\u2019t have anything else for. A new Digital Short has Samberg and Yang singing about how everybody who every worked at SNL had anxiety (and IBS). Lorne Michaels, Chris Parnell, Will Forte and the show\u2019s crew all pop in. Then Aubrey Plaza drops by to introduce the next musical act, Miley Cyrus and Brittany Howard, who perform Nothing Compares 2 U. Although originally a Prince song, the track became a number one hit when Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor covered it in 1990. O\u2019Connor infamously had her career derailed after tearing up a picture of Pope John Paul II (in protest for Catholic church\u2019s culpability in wiping out indigenous cultures and its widespread sexual abuse of minors) while performing on SNL in 1992. The show disavowed her and her actions in the aftermath. This seems to be a tribute to the late Irish singer, but because there is no explicit mea culpa (despite history proving her actions 100% justified), it plays as false and even galling. Colin Jost and Michael Che look back on 50 years of Weekend Update with the help of some old friends. First though, they thank the crew (and congratulate them \u201con their January 6 pardons) and give a heartfelt shoutout to the late, great Norm McDonald\u2019s nemesis OJ Simpson. Norm would undoubtedly have loved this. Guests include segment favorites The Girl You Wish You Hadn\u2019t Started a Conversation With at a Party (Cecily Strong) and Drunk Uncle (Bobby Moynihan), who\u2019ve shacked up and are expecting a baby; Lorne\u2019s Best Friends from Growing Up (Armisen and Vanessa Bayer) who whisper gossip about the cruel showrunner; and former anchors Seth Meyers and Bill Murray, who is there to share his personal ranking of the 10 best Update anchors. Everyone in this Update segment does great work, but, as with Eddie Murphy, Murray is operating on another level. Up next is the return of perennial alien abductee, Coleen Rafferty (Kate McKinnon). She and two of her trailer park buds (Pascal and Woody Harrelson) give testimony of their outer space adventures to two Pentagon officials (Hamm and Aidy Bryant). While the bros shared a transcendent experience, Rafferty had her \u201cunkempt private area\u201d poked and prodded by a group of horny Grays before being unceremoniously pushed out of the spaceship\u2019s hatch. Something feels missing here and its easy to figure out what \u2013 there\u2019s no Ryan Gosling to crack up at McKinnon\u2019s mugging. Meryl Streep does show up as Coleen Sr, but she noticeably struggles with the material. Season one cast member Laraine Newman has her nostalgic tour of the studio interrupted by slacker idiot Chad (Pete Davidson), then we get the absolute pleasure of a surprise appearance from Jack Nicholson. He introduces his Anger Management co-star Adam Sandler for the next musical number. Sandler, guitar in hand, sings a very sweet song about 50 years of SNL. While he mainly lists off the indignities of working on the show \u2013 having sketches cut, hosts visibly reading from cue cards, waking up Sunday afternoons depressed and, above all, living in perpetual fear of Lorne Michaels \u2013 the song climaxes with a moving look back at the tenures of various cast members, the last two spots reserved for his pals Farley and Norm. We continue with the musical acts by way of a brand-new Broadway revue. Anchored by Mulaney and Davidson (as well as David Spade), this giant song-and-dance number charts the sleazy history of New York City from the 1970s up to now, via twisted spins on classic showtunes from the likes of Paul Schafer, Maya Rudolph, Nathan Lane, Jason Sudeikis, Will Forte, Wiig, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Paul Rudd, Nick Jonas, Taran Killam and others. For all its big production, the best bit is Mulaney cavalierly dunking on Sherman\u2019s ultra-brief Michael Bloomberg impression. SNL\u2019s greatest-ever host Alec Baldwin finally shows up to set up a montage of the best commercial parodies in the show\u2019s history, then we get a new Bronx Beat sketch. Rudolph and Poehler\u2019s flirty, brassy hosts pick actor Miles Teller from the audience and bring him on stage to harangue him until they get tired of him. They\u2019re about to sign off when they get a surprise visit from their idol Linda Richman (Mike Myers), host of Coffee Talk. She kvetches with the girls before dispensing some hard-won wisdom: \u201cMaybe the secret of life is there are no big whoops, only a series of small, agonizing whoops.\u201d Myers, like Murphy and Murray, hasn\u2019t missed a beat. Dave Chappelle introduces Lil Wayne and the Roots, then Tom Hanks solemnly takes the stage for what seems to be an in-memoriam segment of dead cast members but, as revealed in a hilarious rug pull, is actually a look back at the \u201cSNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly\u201d. The list includes long roll call of ethnic stereotypes, sexual harassment, underage sexual harassment, animal cruelty, body shaming, slut shaming, gay panic, ableism, sexism, child molestation, questionable makeup (featuring blurred out instances of blackface, brownface and yellowface), problematic guests (OJ Simpson, Robert Blake, Diddy, R Kelly, Jared Fogle), racial slurs and the utterly uncategorizable (Adrien Brody\u2019s baffling and unauthorized Rasta Man act). Kudos for a legitimately sharp bit of self-flagellation. Jimmy Fallon celebrates the occasion by sharing a drink with Ayo Edebiri and Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately for them, their bartender is none other than Debbie Downer (Rachel Dratch), who proceeds to bum them out with depressing facts about alcoholism, animal extinction, bird flu and her gout. She scares them away, only for Robert De Niro to show up. Already on edge because of everything happening in the world, it doesn\u2019t take long for the actor to snap and try to strangle her. Sudeikis returns to play an NYPD officer intent on scaring straight a couple of young shoplifters with the help of Thompson, Murphy and Ferrell\u2019s crazy convicts. Their hardscrabble personal stories and sexual threats fall flat, given that they\u2019re all clearly based around the plots of family movies like Harry Potter, The Nutty Professor and Elf. An odd choice of sketch for this show, but at least Murphy and Ferrell are having a blast. OG cast member Garret Morris pulls up a chair and introduces Tom Schiller\u2019s 1978 black-and-white short film Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger, which finds an elderly John Belushi as the last living cast member of what was then known as, simply, Saturday Night. He visits the graves of his long-gone friends and co-workers, reminiscing about how they each met their end: Jane Curtin died from complications of cosmetic surgery, Morris OD\u2019d on heroin, Chevy Chase bit it right after his first movie with Goldie Hawn, Dan Aykroyd was obliterated in a motorcycle accident. It makes for somewhat eerie viewing considering what real life held in store for all these people, especially Belushi. But it also feels the exact right note to close out the comedy section of this show: edgy (for its time anyway) and unsentimental. Yet, this is an emotional night for the people involved with the show, which makes Paul McCartney\u2019s climactic rendition of the Beatles\u2019 Carry That Weight properly cathartic. As with Simon at the beginning of the special, McCartney looks and sounds his 82 years of age, which adds more power to the lyrics. Martin Short is given the honors of signing off. He shouts out to the original cast members gathered on stage, concluding with a tribute to Lorne Michaels. The hugging then commences. This was a fun, appropriately star-studded celebration, but running throughout was an unmistakable sense of, if not death, then mortality. Man, woman or sketch comedy show \u2013 time comes for us all.",

Heralded by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Carter album and amplified by the release of Post Malone\u2019s F-1 Trillion, the trend also brought huge hits for the hitherto-unknown Shaboozey and Dasha, while Zayn Malik called on the services of a Nashville producer and Lana Del Rey announced a country-influenced album. 2024 also brought with it new stars, most obviously Chappell Roan, who had spent the best part of a decade plugging away in obscurity, being signed then dropped by a major label, before releasing a debut album that slow-burned its way to the top of the charts: The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess initially came out in 2023 to little response (one of its biggest hits, Pink Pony Club, was first released four years ago). As with Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 whose 2024 breakthrough Short N\u2019 Sweet was her sixth album \u2013 Roan had clearly had the space to work out exactly what she wanted to do and how she wanted to present herself, with appealingly idiosyncratic and uncontrived results. But the most striking thing about pop in 2024 was the way it was dominated by a handful of huge, monocultural stories, which spilled out of the music pages into the mainstream news agenda. Continuing from 2023, Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour began the year being described as bigger than the Beatles and Thriller by support act Phoebe Bridgers and ended it officially the highest-grossing tour in history, making Swift a billionaire in the process. By the time it arrived in the UK this summer, the clamour made it impossible to avoid. But it was superseded in the headlines by the release of Charli xcx\u2019s Brat and the announcement we were living through a \u201cBrat summer\u201d: whatever the rather nebulous concept of being \u201cbrat\u201d signified, the idea took dramatic hold, turning up everywhere from the US election campaign to the New Statesman\u2019s posthumous appreciation of Edna O\u2019Brien and the pages of National Geographic, which proclaimed Cleopatra, Lucrezia Borgia and 7th-century Chinese empress Wu Zetian were all \u201cbrat\u201d. Then Oasis announced their 2025 reunion tour. For weeks, it was unavoidable: loud and lengthy expressions of joy; equally loud and lengthy expressions of horror; controversy regarding ticket prices; rosy-hued 90s nostalgia; bitter recriminations regarding the failings of 90s pop culture; and explorations of the curious phenomenon of teenagers too young to remember Oasis\u2019s 2009 split, let alone their golden years, yet apparently thrilled by their reappearance. On the face of it, these three mega-stories were all quite different. The Eras tour had a sense of finality \u2013 it was difficult for even the most hysterical devotee to see how Swift could possibly top this career-summarising greatest hits show. The success of Brat, meanwhile, seemed to herald a new era in mainstream pop that was messier, brasher, wittier and wilfully trashier, a reaction to years of self-help platitudes, wellness culture and perfectly choreographed pop. (You could see something similar in Roan\u2019s drag-inspired aesthetic \u2013 the cover of her single Good Luck, Babe! had her sporting a prosthetic pig\u2019s snout \u2013 and in Carpenter\u2019s gleefully acidic lyrics.) At the risk of sounding like the writer trying to crowbar Charli xcx into a piece about Edna O\u2019Brien, one could argue the V-flicking Gallaghers are, well, brat; if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to wellness culture and self-care bromides, they\u2019ve got a song called Cigarettes and Alcohol that\u2019s very much in favour of both. But their reunion was still predicated on nostalgia, with even teenage fans buying into a myth of the 90s as a kind of prelapsarian age, before social media and smartphones, that was less fraught than the present day. And yet, all three stories had something in common. For years now, pop has favoured the individual over the collective \u2013 this year groups such as Flo have continued to struggle, and some of the biggest global hits were from newly solo K-pop stars such as Jimin of BTS and Ros\u00e9 and Lisa of Blackpink \u2013 and the way pop is consumed has also narrowed. Streaming\u2019s algorithms serve up music ostensibly tailored to your own personal tastes. The price of tickets has turned gig-going into a special occasion you indulge in once or twice a year rather than enjoy on a regular basis. Fandoms have become weird, often troubling things that seem to exist as disembodied online entities firing pissy, anonymous social media messages to their idol\u2019s rivals. The things music fans used to gather around \u2013 TV and radio shows, the music press, even the charts \u2013 are either fading in importance or essentially defunct. Yet there remains an innate desire for collective experience, for music to provide a sense of community. You could see it in the burgeoning popularity of dance music: a DJ like Sammy Virji may have made little impact on the charts, but he can still sell out two nights at Brixton Academy; the nocturnal dance events at Glastonbury were so over-subscribed, some had to be closed down due to overcrowding. You could see it in the crowds that flocked to the Eras gigs, who seemed noticeably different from other pop audiences, and were big on intriguingly homespun rituals \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if Swift or her management had told them to come in costume, or trade friendship bracelets, or draw the number 13 on their hands, or develop a series of if-you-know-you-know responses to particular moments in certain songs. You could see it in a willingness to buy into the notion of Brat and Brat summer, a way of defining yourself, however nebulously, through music in a post-tribal era, when pop is supposed to have lost its ability to affect the way its audience defines itself. And you could see it in the commotion caused by the return of Oasis. Whatever else you make of it, Oasis\u2019s oeuvre is absolutely predicated on collective experience: their songs sound like songs written specifically for vast crowds of people to bellow along to en masse; they\u2019re probably best experienced in the middle of said crowd, drunk, with your arms around your friends. Indeed, collective experience is so entrenched in Oasis\u2019s appeal that their music has literally become a signifier of it. In recent years, advertisers have reached for Stand By Me and Round Are Way in commercials tagged, respectively \u201cit\u2019s a people thing\u201d and \u201cwe can all do our bit for our community\u201d. So perhaps that\u2019s the underlying message of pop in 2024: people still want to be part of something bigger than themselves, and they\u2019ll still use pop to do it, even in an age when audiences are supposed to be atomised and individually sated by the algorithm. If it is, that\u2019s a hopeful note to end a frequently hopeless year on.",
