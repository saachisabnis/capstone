        "bodyText": "Charli xcx has won five Brit awards, including album of the year for her summer-defining, green-hued, magnificently debauched album Brat. At the ceremony in London\u2019s O2 Arena, she was also awarded British artist of the year, song of the year for Guess (featuring Billie Eilish), and one of the five genre awards, for dance act. Earlier in the week she was named songwriter of the year. The wins cap a zeitgeist-surfing year for the singer, whose knowingly trashy sound and look was so distinctive it gave rise to a whole cultural phenomenon: \u201cBrat summer\u201d, plus various things being declared \u201cbrat\u201d. It was nebulously defined \u2013 Charli asserted that the seemingly un-brat Kamala Harris was, in fact, brat \u2013 but centred around untrammelled raving, unclean living and unbothered cool. Brat topped the UK chart and has spent 38 weeks in the Top 20, and was critically acclaimed for its range: between the club bangers lay a series of thoughtful, romantic and emotionally raw tracks that laid bare Charli\u2019s anxieties about fame and potential motherhood. It was also a success in the US, reaching No 3 and winning three Grammys. She thanked some of her dance music heroes \u2013 resulting in probably the first mention of Autechre at the Brit awards \u2013 as well as Eilish for turning her contribution to Guess around in a handful of days, saying: \u201cNot all artists are [as] spontaneous, despite claiming that they are.\u201d On winning album of the year, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like an outsider ... particularly in the British music industry. So it feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven\u2019t made any sacrifices.\u201d She told her fellow artists: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to compromise your vision.\u201d The chief architect of Brat\u2019s dance-pop sound, AG Cook, won the Brit award for producer of the year. He also released a solo album during the awards\u2019 eligibility period, entitled Britpop. Charli \u2013 real name Charlotte Aitchison, 32 \u2013 first released music back in 2008, but these are her first Brit award wins following four previous nominations. Only one artist has ever won more Brits in a single year: Raye, who set the record last year with six, and who has now added to her overall haul by winning R&amp;B act for the second year in a row. Another act adding to a 2024 win was the Last Dinner Party. The flamboyant five-piece were given the rising star award last year, and have now picked up best new artist. Playing an expansive style of classic rock and alt-pop, their debut album Prelude to Ecstasy went to No 1 in February 2024, and they have become regarded as one of the UK\u2019s best live acts. Bassist Georgia Davies said they \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a band without the UK\u2019s incredible independent venues \u2013 they are the lifebood of the industry, and they are dying\u201d. She called on arena operators to financially support grassroots venues, and told artists who play the latter to \u201ckeep going, because that\u2019s the best kind of art there is\u201d. The Last Dinner Party lost out in the British group category, though, to a giantkilling underdog: jazz quintet Ezra Collective, who also beat Coldplay, the Cure and Bring Me the Horizon. Playing propulsive instrumentals influenced by Fela Kuti as well as hip-hop, funk and spiritual jazz, they are the leading light in London\u2019s recently resurgent jazz scene. Like the Last Dinner Party, their live show is hugely acclaimed, and in November they became the first British jazz act to play London\u2019s 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena. They\u2019re also the first jazz group to win a Brit award, and in 2023 they became the first jazz act to win the Mercury prize. After picking up the award, bandleader Femi Koleoso appealed for support for youth clubs and music education, saying: \u201cSo many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, we\u2019re unsure of how to fix, but the solution likes with giving a young person a trumpet, a saxophone \u2013 because when you do that you give them an aspiration, a goal.\u201d In the genre categories \u2013 which were voted for by the public \u2013 Sam Fender picked up the rock/alternative act prize for the second time, in the week he hit No 1 with his third album People Watching: the fastest-selling vinyl album by a British artist this century, and the biggest opening week for a British artist since Harry Styles in 2022. Waggishly introduced by host Jack Whitehall as \u201ca man who has put more smiles on Geordie faces than a Turkish dentist\u201d, Fender also performed his new album\u2019s title track. Former Little Mix member Jade beat Charli xcx to best pop act, having transitioned into a successful solo career with the hit single Angel of My Dreams. She adds to her three wins with Little Mix, including in 2021 when they became the first female act to win British group. She also beat Dua Lipa, who had a night to forget, not winning any of her four nominated categories. He may have won three Brits in the past and remains a commercial heavyweight, but Stormzy was something of a surprise winner in the hip-hop/grime/rap category. Central Cee had been the favourite, having become the country\u2019s most globally popular rapper in recent years (though, like Fender, his recent No 1 album Can\u2019t Rush Greatness isn\u2019t eligible until next year\u2019s Brits). As well as quoting a Bible psalm and saying he had bruised his cornea playing Padel, Stormzy namechecked Central Cee in his acceptance speech, saying that while he was grateful for the win, \u201cI don\u2019t entirely think this award should be fan-voted \u2026 sometimes I think it doesn\u2019t let people have their moments. Cench was the rap artist of the year.\u201d The public vote was between mid-January and mid-February, meaning that the outcry at Stormzy\u2019s recent McDonald\u2019s campaign did not affect his votes. This year\u2019s rising star award was given in December to singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was nominated for three further awards, including song of the year for his huge hit Stargazing, which he performed at the ceremony along with Nice to Meet You. Picking up the award, the working-class Luton musician addressed the British government: \u201cIf British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?\u201d \u201cWe have to protect the foundations that make it,\u201d he added. Like the Last Dinner Party, he appealed to arena operators to support British grassroots venues, and asked the music industry: \u201cAre we building careers, or are we just chasing moments \u2026 please stick with artists past a viral hit.\u201d It was a sentiment shared by Chappell Roan, who called for artists to \u201cnot be pressured into making music based off what is trending\u201d as she picked up the international song award for Good Luck, Babe! The US pop singer-songwriter also won the award for international artist, which she dedicated to \u201ctrans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor.\u201d Irish rockers Fontaines DC picked up international group, their second win in that category. Introduced by Diana Ross and Millie Bobby Brown, Sabrina Carpenter was given the reactivated global success award, following a year in which she had three UK No 1 singles plus a No 1 album. She thanked her British fans, saying: \u201cIn a primarily tea-drinking country, you\u2019ve streamed the shit out of Espresso \u2026 cheerio!\u201d Carpenter opened the live show to the strains of Rule, Britannia! with dancers dressed as Buckingham Palace guards, segueing into a performance of the chart-topping Espresso and then a watershed testing, raunchy rendition of Bed Chem. The show also featured performances from Jade, the Last Dinner Party, British singer Lola Young, US singer Teddy Swims, and Ezra Collective, who performed alongside London youth group Kinetika Bloco and two-time Brit winner Jorja Smith. Whitehall, who previously hosted the show between 2018 and 2021, returned with a hail of good-natured jibes targeting the likes of Simon Cowell, KSI, Coldplay (\u201cthe public school Nickelback\u201d) and even the previous day\u2019s \u201ccringe\u201d Zelenskyy-Trump meeting. He skirted the boundaries of good taste with one comment about Jade\u2019s live performance, saying: \u201cI really thought Diddy might have done it for the white party theme\u201d, and later referenced sex toys and an adult film actor \u2013 all of it casting the Brits as the award season\u2019s bawdiest, booziest event. But he also led a heartfelt in memoriam segment to Liam Payne, calling him an \u201cincredibly kind soul\u201d. Aside from the publicly voted genre categories, the Brits are voted for by the 1,338-strong Brits Academy, populated by musicians as well as industry and media figures.

        "trailText": "The Brat star commands the stage alone in a joyful arena show that feels more like a warehouse rave",
        "bodyText": "Charli xcx is smoking a cigarette and surveying her disciples from an elevated platform. Most are clad in the ubiquitous slime green that adorned the cover of June\u2019s culture-swallowing Brat album, while some sport the same wraparound glasses as their unapologetic idol. Everyone is dancing in unison to Apple, a curious bop about nature v nurture, fruit and airports, that went viral thanks to a TikTok dance. The Essex 32-year-old nonchalantly waves her cigarette like a baton, controlling an orchestra of mainly gay men and young women, before unleashing a familiar trigger warning for an oncoming crowd meltdown: \u201cManchester, where the fuck you at?\u201d she roars as delirium ensues. It\u2019s an unexpected spectacle. When this short UK arena tour was first announced in April, it felt slightly overambitious for a peripheral but hugely influential pop star. Charli\u2019s flirtations with mainstream success \u2013 Boom Clap, Fancy, 1999 \u2013 were often sandwiched between more outre experimentations with various affiliates of gonzo UK electronic label PC Music, moving her into \u201cif you know, you know\u201d territory. Even 2022\u2019s Crash, her knowing attempt at being a pop sellout, only spent two weeks in the UK Top 40. This year all that has changed. From the British high street to the US presidential elections, via memes, a dedicated season (\u201cHow to have a Brat summer\u201d, ran one Vogue piece) and nine Grammy nominations, Charli\u2019s sixth album has mushroomed into a phenomenon. That garish shade of green is still everywhere, while \u201cbrat\u201d was recently named Collins\u2019s word of the year and redefined as \u201ca confident, independent and hedonistic attitude\u201d. Musically, Brat married Charli\u2019s brand of forward-thinking, jagged dance-pop to easily digestible lyrics slathered in partying, sex and drugs, tapping into a collective desire for reckless escapism. October\u2019s spin-off remix album, Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different but Also Still Brat, welcomed superstars Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish into her orbit and propelled Brat to No 1 in the UK and No 3 in America. Like those two artists, Charli can now command a stage on her own terms. Flanked by two huge screens and a runway that leads to a small B-stage, with no band and no dancers, she is left to her own devices. The minimalism, paired with retina-melting strobe lights and the occasional puff of a smoke machine, gives the heavily sponsored arena the grimy feel of a warehouse rave. That\u2019s cemented by a frantic opening section that starts with a remix of 365, featuring fellow experimentalist Shygirl, and quickly crashes into the swaggering 360 (\u201cI\u2019m your favourite reference, baby\u201d). Shimmying in ruffled hot pants in front of a floor-to-ceiling fabric screen in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Brat green, Charli suddenly yanks it down to reveal nothing but more space for her to stomp around. But Brat is more than just a party soundtrack, and tonight the gloriously empty tracks rub shoulders with songs that muse on alienation, questions of self-worth and loss. Rewind and I Might Say Something Stupid grapple with impostor syndrome \u2013 something you assume Brat may have only complicated \u2013 while the gorgeous So I, and its more pulverising remix, honour Charli\u2019s friend and collaborator Sophie, who died in 2021. In the show\u2019s club context, these are the moments you snot-cry on a friend\u2019s shoulder, locked in a memory, before the lights change, a massive bass drops and you\u2019re off again. A pummelling Spring Breakers follows, performed under the Perspex runway and beamed on to the screens as if filmed on a janky iPhone. Two of Brat\u2019s biggest remixes are also aired: the sapphic, Billie Eilish-assisted Guess and Girl, So Confusing, featuring Lorde, which finds the pair working out their differences over thunderous electropop. Neither guest star is present tonight, with their respective verses thrown over to the sweat-drenched crowd. Charli, meanwhile, sashays up and down the runway, revelling in her own status as go-to collaborator and surveying the magnificent mess she\u2019s made. She then adds to it by spitting on the floor and dropping to her knees to lick it up. Hopped-up Barbie anthem Speed Drive and the elasticated snap, crackle and pop of Vroom Vroom whiz by in a blur, while even the midtempo moments such as Party 4 U feature bowel-rupturing bass notes that shake the walls. As the set nears its climax, the B-stage becomes a giant shower, Charli splashing around to the detuned artifice of 2017\u2019s blown-out ballad Track 10. It\u2019s a small moment of arena pop spectacle, but the singer\u2019s irony-laden, designer sleaze still makes it feel more foam party than early 00s Britney. Sopping wet, she then tears into a I Love It, her UK No 1 collaboration with Icona Pop from 2012. It\u2019s a neat reminder of how long Charli xcx has been around, and how far she\u2019s come. In between the hype woman overtures \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t fucking hear you!\u201d, \u201cLouder, bitches\u201d and \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d get more than one airing tonight \u2013 she tells us that one of her first gigs was in Manchester \u201cto 10 people\u201d. As 20,000 fans roar back now, the 365 party girl allows herself a moment: \u201cThanks for sticking by me\u201d. It turns out sentimentality, like everything else, is so Brat.",

        "trailText": "<strong>Brisbane Showgrounds, then touring Australia<br></strong>As other events collapse, the rapturous young crowds turning out for the 20th Laneway proves that there is still a huge appetite in Australia for the festival experience",
        "bodyText": "It\u2019s the end of Brat summer as we know it and we all feel fine. Charli xcx\u2019s exclusive headline slot is the major drawcard for the 20th year of St Jerome\u2019s Laneway festival, as the British hyperpop star runs a victory lap for her Grammy-winning album, Brat. At the first leg of the Australian festival, a sold-out Brisbane Showgrounds is teeming with punters bedecked in the album\u2019s signature lime green. It\u2019s a victory lap of sorts for Laneway, too, one of the last festivals of its kind in a rapidly shrinking Australian live landscape (last month, Splendour in the Grass and Groovin the Moo were both canned for the second year in a row). What started as a small boutique event in an inner-city Melbourne laneway now boasts crowds of tens of thousands, and tours around the country and even overseas. It feels like what the Big Day Out once was but for a new generation, and the very young crowd reflect that. The downside is that Laneway\u2019s personality now feels diluted \u2013 it has become a festival for the masses. What was once an opportunity for punters to discover new, smaller artists has shifted towards a smorgasbord of who\u2019s hot right now, particularly online. The influence of social media is strongly felt at the festival, epitomised in Djo\u2019s set. The Stranger Things actor gets a largely muted response until his final song, End of Beginning \u2013 which was a viral TikTok sound in snippet form \u2013 sends the crowd wild and has phones up in selfie mode as punters take videos, presumably to also upload to the app. It\u2019s emblematic of how the younger generation interacts with music now but feels jarring to witness \u2013 how this might play out in years to come remains to be seen. But the past is always present: gen Z\u2019s fascination with nostalgia is evident in some of the acts, including the US shoegazers Julie, all in their early 20s but playing a brand of fuzzed-out rock that sounds straight from the 90s. The band has an early slot as the blazing sun beats relentlessly down and their walls of distortion awaken the crowd. Later Clairo\u2019s sunset set crackles as though it\u2019s spinning on an old record player, though the US singer-songwriter \u2013 also a festival exclusive \u2013 struggles to be heard above an uneven, bass-heavy sound mix. This isn\u2019t the best setting for her introspective, 70s-inspired music but she\u2019s a charming performer \u2013 fitting as the set is mostly made up of songs from her latest album, Charm, with intricate instrumental arrangements. Live, Clairo\u2019s band includes clarinet and a rousing saxophone solo on Sexy to Someone; the older track Bags taps into an indie-rock vibe that\u2019s more suited to a large festival. This is carried on in Beabadoobee\u2019s later set, which feels both intimate and expansive. Olivia Dean feels like a companion: smooth, soulful tunes delivered with style, providing a more chilled-out experience than the festival\u2019s otherwise EDM-heavy lineup. It\u2019s particularly moving when the British singer dedicates a track, Carmen, to her grandmother. Joccy\u2019s stage is one of the only undercover areas of the festival, providing respite from the sun but heating up quickly with dancing bodies \u2013 it\u2019s reminiscent of the BDO\u2019s Boiler Room. Melbourne\u2019s Rona is an early highlight, spinning tracks with seamless transitions against a flashing red Indigenous flag. A remix of Ojax\u2019s Act a Fool has the crowd roaring and Rona looks as though she\u2019s having a blast too as she throws shapes on stage. The Pennsylvania hip-hop duo Joey Valence and Brae, on the rapid rise, drop an incredibly fun remix of Charli xcx\u2019s 365 alongside their own high-energy tracks including The Baddest and Freaks, creating a sweaty sea of hands. Ninajirachi keeps the party going between sets all afternoon with an interstitial soundtrack of remixed pop hits. The last time Charli xcx appeared at Laneway, in 2020, she was still somewhat of an underground favourite \u2013 now she\u2019s ascended to become the queen of the cultural zeitgeist with a record that\u2019s equal parts fun and intelligent. The venue transforms into an open-air club for a joyous 70 minutes as she blazes through tracks from Brat, with a few older songs thrown into the mix (the moving Track 10 is a highlight) and the requisite silly songs about fast cars (Vroom Vroom, Speed Drive). Unlike most other pop stars playing stadium shows, Charli is alone on stage. She doesn\u2019t need anyone else \u2013 she\u2019s larger than life, prowling at the camera closeup and making good use of the tiered stage. The TikTok phenomenon is present in this set too, with the singer encouraging fans to perform the viral Apple dance, created by a fan. It adds to the fun. I Love It, Charli\u2019s 2012 collaboration with Icona Pop, now feels passe among her more adventurous catalogue but it\u2019s the perfect singalong to end the night. The rapturous crowd proves that there is still a huge appetite in Australia for the festival experience, particularly among the younger generation who are hungry for the community and euphoria that only live music can bring. Let\u2019s hope this is a sign of better things to come. Laneway continues in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth until 16 February",

        "bodyText": "If there was ever something that could shock away the midweek doldrums, it\u2019s the sight of Charli xcx spitting on the floor as she performs the remix of Guess featuring Billie Eilish, only to dive to the ground and lick it up. Hygienic? Perhaps not. But is it Brat? Clearly. This is the opening night of the Brat tour, after all. Of course, this is a show many have been waiting for. While Charli\u2019s sixth album was only released earlier this summer, the record\u2019s impact \u2013 from its lime-green coloured album cover, messy party girl aesthetic and subsequent co-option by political figures \u2013 has led to the kind of cultural dominance that most pop stars dream of. For Charli, it was a long time coming: having spent most of her career as pop\u2019s most innovative outsider slowly inching her way into the mainstream, she finally shot into her imperial phase with the best album of her career. Watching her perform, however, that graft was clearly worth it: tonight\u2019s show is a masterclass in stage presence. She forgoes the bells and whistles associated with an arena show. There are no backing dancers, no elaborate sets, and aside from support act Shygirl, who pops up at the beginning to perform their remix of 365, no special guests. Instead, for 90 minutes Charli is on stage alone. This is her moment of glory. The setlist is mostly Brat-focused, bulldozing through 360, Von Dutch and Rewind in a hedonistic rush. Even the sombre I Might Say Something Stupid gets dragged into the fray, the song exploding with synths as Charli thrashes on stage. It is often relentless, but exhilaratingly so: when Everything is Romantic, Speed Drive and Sympathy is a Knife come like a shot of adrenaline. Girl, So Confusing and Apple get the biggest response, Charli taking a smoke break on stage during the latter, and there\u2019s a surprisingly moving tribute to the late producer Sophie when she performs the clubby remix of So I for the first time. The energy turns feral during Guess and gets messier during 365, Charli crawling with sweaty abandon along the catwalk. It\u2019s so wild that you feel like you\u2019ve taken an intoxicated trip to some sleazy after-hours club. That she sells it while putting on one of the best shows of the year is proof of Charli\u2019s powers as a pop star. \u2022 Charli xcx plays O2 Arena, London, 28 November; BP Pulse Live, Birmingham, 29 November; and OVO Hydro, Glasgow, 2 December.",

If Charli xcx \u2013 and producer AG Cook \u2013 hadn\u2019t been lavishly rewarded for her agenda-setting album Brat, you would have wondered what had gone wrong: likewise Chappell Roan, whose ardent emotion both in and out of the recording studio makes her one of pop\u2019s most cheering recent developments: she responded to her two awards with acceptance speeches that called upon the music industry to offer more long-term development support to artists \u2013 a theme also picked up on by Myles Smith, winner of the rising star award \u2013 and shouted out the trans community and sex workers. Cannily, the Brits managed to elbow in a third big pop name of 2024, too. The global success award was mysteriously reactivated for the first time in six years and, more mysteriously still, repurposed. Previously given to British artists who\u2019d reaped vast commercial dividends abroad \u2013 One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Adele \u2013 it went to Sabrina Carpenter, who\u2019s certainly reaped vast commercial dividends over the last 12 months, but hails from Pennsylvania. It\u2019s meant as no smear on Carpenter herself, a witty and self-knowing star whose album Short n\u2019 Sweet went to No 1 in 18 countries and contained a succession of superb, similarly chart-topping singles, but you did rather get the feeling the Brits were making up an award to give to her and \u2013 given the absence of Roan \u2013 secure her presence at the event itself. She repaid their gesture by performing Espresso with dancers dressed as Coldstream guardsmen and interpolating the song with the strains of Rule! Britannia. Among the other expected victories, Sam Fender\u2019s success came at the end of a week in which his third album entered the UK charts at No 1, selling more than 100,000 copies in the process; and Fontaines DC won international group on the back of Romance, an album that successfully managed to shift them in a more commercial direction without sacrificing any of their potency or aggression. Jade Thirlwall was rewarded for a string of solo singles that fit perfectly into the new more expansive pop zeitgeist: with its sample of Sandie Shaw\u2019s Puppet on a String and its sudden shifts in tempo and mood, Angel of My Dreams in particular was vastly more inventive and unpredictable than anything she recorded while a member of Little Mix, underlined by an episodic live performance so peculiar it stole the show. If Stormzy\u2019s victory over Central Cee in the public vote for hip-hop/grime/rap artist seemed a little surprising \u2013 as he pointed out in an acceptance speech that essentially seemed to be suggesting he didn\u2019t think he should have won, the only big hit he\u2019s recently had was from an appearance on Chase and Status\u2019s Backbone \u2013 the most striking win was Ezra Collective, and not merely because you might have expected the Cure to win best group instead (both as a nod to the success of Songs of a Lost World, their first album in 16 years, and as a kind of long-service medal). Critics have been suggesting that Ezra Collective might cross over to the mainstream for some years now, more out of hope than expectation: for all the influence they draw from hip-hop, dub, Afrobeat and dance music, they remain at heart a jazz quintet. And yet their career has recently surged. They won the Mercury prize in 2023, scored their first Top 10 album with last year\u2019s Dance, No One\u2019s Watching and became the first British jazz act to headline Wembley Arena: precisely the kind of success that the Brits should be celebrating.",

        "bodyText": "Chat Pile \u2013 Cool World I often feel overwhelmed by the lengths some people will go to literally watch the world burn. Chat Pile seem to understand this. Cool World demonstrates the rage we should all feel towards those whose greed comes at the expense of human existence. It\u2019s class. Rob, 28, Newcastle Bashy \u2013 Being Poor Is Expensive It\u2019s hard to describe the emotional impact this album has had, or its intellectual range, but I\u2019ll try. It starts with The London Borough of Brent, a truly stunning statement piece, 15 years on from his last album. Who would\u2019ve thought a psychogeographical deep dive (\u201canywhere from Kilburn up to Edgware, anywhere from Kensal Green to Wembley, anywhere from Stonebridge down to Camden\u201d) contrasted with the realities of fiscal drag (\u201cGotta pay tax, payment due, just to see a million you gotta make two\u201d) could be so thrilling? From sampling his own grandma on Made in Britain, to unpicking how structural racism robs Black boys of their innocence and childhoods on How Black Men Lose Their Smile, Bashy draws the listener in over 38 minutes, making his arguments with skill and moral clarity. Ben Diamond, London Magdalena Bay \u2013 Imaginal Disk One of the best pop albums I\u2019ve ever heard. Immaculate production and incredible songwriting. The album flows perfectly and hits powerful emotional highs throughout. You can hear the prog rock influence as well as Abba, Radiohead and Grimes. My personal favourite is Angel on a Satellite. It has a gorgeous piano melody and beautiful vocals from Mica [Tenenbaum]. Jamie Colclough, 25, Sunderland Jack White \u2013 No Name I was on maternity leave for most of 2024 and did a lot of walking. This album and the occasional coffee kept me going on very little sleep. Every song feels like a banger: the driving drums, endless hooks and clever lyrics are truly joyful. It\u2019s Jack White at his finest and all I want for Christmas this year is the announcement of a 2025 European tour (preferably a few nights in Amsterdam\u2019s iconic Paradiso!) Amanda Gowland, 43, Amsterdam Waxahatchee \u2013 Tigers Blood It\u2019s expansive; it\u2019s intimate; it\u2019s fast; it\u2019s slow; it\u2019s got it all. The songs all sort of sound the same, but I don\u2019t mind that one bit. I\u2019ve had it on repeat since it came out, and even more often since I got to see the band live at Leeds Irish Centre on a warm July evening. It was one of those gigs where it felt like everyone I had ever met was there, and for good reason. If you haven\u2019t heard it, start with Right Back to It (featuring MJ Lenderman), it\u2019s perfect. Julia, 28, Leeds Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Brat has to be my favourite album of 2024. As someone who has supported Charli xcx for years it was a breath of fresh air to finally receive an album where she was unapologetically herself. The response to the album has been incredible to witness as Brat transcended music to become the cultural moment of the year. But at the end of the day, brat is a love letter from Charli to the fans who\u2019ve stuck with her for years so she can reach the level of superstardom we always wanted her to reach. Noah, 21, Glasgow Ashe \u2013 Willson I loved Willson by Ashe this year. It\u2019s indie pop with a little country at its best: beautiful storytelling and engaging sounds, all wrapped up with heavenly vocals. It\u2019s a story about being faced with no choice but stepping back when you\u2019ve realised you\u2019ve lost yourself, until finding it again step by step, and claiming your narrative back. I felt as if I was right with her when she was carving names in cherry trees, unable to leave the house and \u201ccalling in sick to the rest of this year\u201d, leaving California behind and taking herself back. Mathilde, Edinburgh Annie Hamilton \u2013 Stop and Smell the Lightning It\u2019s a rollercoaster with upbeat songs, standing out for their danceable beats and layered production, pairing nicely with quieter, more introspective numbers. Annie\u2019s been plugging away making fantastic music and touring for around five years now. With the singles for this album indicating she was working with new sounds and exploring new genres, it was interesting to see how it would sound as an album. She pulls off a combination of electronic elements and grimy indie rock songs, ballads, etc. With lyrics touching on relationships, grief, self-discovery and joy, it\u2019s a well-written, up and down journey, reflective of life and the ever-changing world we live in. Ben Crewe, 28, Lille, France Jamie xx \u2013 In Waves A work of sheer genius. I believe that he\u2019s tried to capture the essence of dancefloors and he\u2019s done that so well. Daffodil reminds me of a 1976 summer\u2019s day; sheer Isley bros vibes right there. From the euphoric opening of the classic samples, to the poetic charm of All You Children; so perfect to have the Avalanches on there. But the standout track for me is Life, and this album is giving me LIFE! Sue Cattanach, 64, Brighton Halsey \u2013 The Great Impersonator It\u2019s a favourite as it\u2019s a sonically diverse album, and although I often prefer heavier music, the lyricism of Halsey has always captivated me. It explores chronic illness, life and death in a moving way yet not so much so that it is agonising to continually listen to. Although my favourite songs on the album are the bonus tracks for their more uplifting nature. Eloise, 24, Norfolk Tyler, the Creator \u2013 Chromakopia A perfect blend of pop, rap and hip-hop. This album is full of introspection and fear. On Like Him, Tyler reflects on never getting to meet his father and how that has affected him. Another track that demonstrates his pure vocal power is Darling, I. From the moment I first heard it, I knew I would be enthralled, and the song Noid is filled with fears for his safety and the safety of his friends. Oliver, Ireland King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard \u2013 Flight b741 It somehow sounds like the 70s music I grew up listening to with my dad. It\u2019s both a feelgood and a feel-bad kind of record with its music and lyrics. Since things have been so weird in the world recently, I have been listening to this album even more than usual. I feel that Flight b741 somehow both embraces all of the anxiety about the state of things and offers an escape from it. Isabel, 19, Texas, US James \u2013 Yummy Euphoric and anthemic, it captures the joy and wonder of life while hitting topical issues such as our tech reliance, the climate crisis, and conspiracy theories. A well-deserved first No 1 album after 40 years. Sam Armitage, Wales Fontaines DC \u2013 Romance I kept my expectations for Fontaines\u2019 fourth album modest (how could they possibly improve upon 2022\u2019s Skinty Fia?) and I realised I was foolish for it before the full album even dropped. The lead single, Starburster, became a staple on my running playlist before that first, unsettling intake of breath a minute and a half in. Fontaines get sexy, moody, angry, and fun on Romance. The opening track, for which the album is named, is gloomy and heavy and makes the concept of romance feel both inviting and threatening \u2013 how true! We get a song about a love affair with a makeup artist at Carnegie Hall, as well as a tender, slower track inspired by James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses. It\u2019s the perfect album for a long walk on a rainy day. The closer, Favourite, is aptly named: a dreamy rock song that can make you feel happy and sad at once \u2013 my favourite kind.

        "bodyText": "Charli xcx leads this year\u2019s Brit awards with five nominations for her 2024-dominating record Brat \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s album of last year. With four nominations apiece, Dua Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith are close on the pop star\u2019s trail. xcx is nominated for album, artist and song of the year \u2013 the latter for the remix of Guess featuring Billie Eilish \u2013 and in the dance and pop genre categories. But despite xcx painting the British music industry\u2019s annual party a violent shade of lime green, women remain underrepresented in this year\u2019s nominations, accounting for 34.7% of the 98 slots. Male acts comprise more than half, at 53%, with mixed-gender acts and collaborations \u2013 including the Last Dinner Party \u2013 making up the remaining 12.3%. It\u2019s a noteworthy year for some vintage groups: the Beatles\u2019 AI-abetted Now and Then is up for best song, the group\u2019s first nomination since the very first Brit awards in 1977. (Prior to becoming an annual fixture in 1983, the first Brits marked Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s silver jubilee and 100 years since the invention of the phonograph, and honoured the preceding 25 years in music, seeing the Beatles earn three nominations.) And with three nominations for Songs of a Lost World \u2013 their first album since 2008 \u2013 the Cure score their first Brit nominations in more than 30 years in the categories for album of the year, group of the year and alt/rock act. At the newer end of the scale, Stargazing singer Smith is this year\u2019s Rising Star winner, tipped by the industry for major success, and is also nominated for new artist, song and pop act. The genre categories are assembled by the Brits voting academy and then voted for by members of the public via WhatsApp. Predictably, the category for hip-hop/grime/rap act features just one woman, Little Simz, alongside Central Cee, Dave, Ghetts and Stormzy. London jazz act Ezra Collective may also be set for a breakthrough year. The five-piece released their third album, Dance, No One\u2019s Watching, in September, after winning the 2023 Mercury prize for their second album. \u201cFrom a youth club to the Brit awards and beyond,\u201d they said in a statement. Some may raise eyebrows at a group active since 2016 being up for new artist \u2013 alongside last year\u2019s Mercury winners English Teacher, the Last Dinner Party, Myles Smith and former Brit School student Rachel Chinouriri \u2013 but the category parameters stipulate that acts must have had one Top 40 album or single in the eligibility period, but can\u2019t have had a Top 10 album or more than one Top 10 single, nor have had prior nominations for best artist, group or album. Despite middling reviews for her third album Radical Optimism \u2013 which spent just 19 weeks in the UK Top 100, compared to 220 for her 2020 record Future Nostalgia \u2013 Lipa is nominated for album of the year, artist of the year, song of the year (for Training Season) and pop act. Last year\u2019s major winner, Raye \u2013 who took home six prizes in 2024 \u2013 is up for R&amp;B act. \u201cI\u2019m still processing the ridiculousness that was last year!\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to watch Charli xcx clean up this year, she just deserves it so much.\u201d Some nascent comebacks also feature: Sam Fender is up for artist of the year and alt/rock act, despite only having released two singles from his forthcoming third album, People Watching, due in February; and Jade, of the on-hiatus band Little Mix, is up for song of the year (for Angel of My Dreams) and pop act. In the international categories, Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish have two nods apiece; Eilish also clocks a third nomination alongside xcx in the song category. \u201cThank you so much for the nominations and the recognition of my art,\u201d Roan said in a statement. \u201cThe UK has always shown me so much love and championed me through these past few years. It was one of the first places that Good Luck, Babe! blew up in, so this feels extra special.\u201d The awards for producer and songwriter of the year will be announced prior to the ceremony, which takes place on 1 March at the O2 Arena in London.

        "bodyText": "You have a identical twin. Do you have any spooky twin stories? Honestly, not really. We\u2019re deeply intuitive about each other. We are mirror twins, which is \u2013 like, it\u2019s not really recognised in the medical community, but my mom always tells me about it. It\u2019s when the egg splits at the last possible moment, before you could be conjoined, maybe? Instead you have a mirror image. So, she\u2019s left-handed; I\u2019m right-handed. Her hair parted on one side when she was a kid; mine, on the other. She got one tooth first, then I got the exact same tooth but the opposite side. So we\u2019re basically perfect mirror images of each other. It\u2019s kind of junk science, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told our whole lives. Your partner [Kevin Morby] is also a musician. Do you guys have any rules about writing songs about each other? Oh my gosh, maybe we should! No, we don\u2019t have any rules. We\u2019re both good sports. In the past, if we\u2019ve gone through a rough patch and we\u2019ve written about it, that\u2019s always a little sensitive. But I think that the beautiful thing about both being songwriters is that we both understand our whole mission in life is to write great songs. It\u2019s all for the sake of the song. So I think, within reason, all bets are off. If you could have a sandwich named after you, what would be on it? I think it would probably be a sandwich that you can get at this bodega called Verti Marte in New Orleans. It is on French bread and has ham, turkey, cheese, grilled onions and grilled tomatoes with shrimp and remoulade. It sounds crazy. It\u2019s so good. I would have it renamed the Katie. Have you ever had a cringeworthy run in with a celebrity? When I was in high school, I drove to Atlanta to see Jenny Lewis with all of my 16-year-old best friends. We were in Little Five Points in Atlanta, and we saw her walking between vintage stores, and sort of followed her around \u2026 But I met her years later and played it totally cool. We have an unspoken understanding. She knows just how much her music has meant to me. What album is on heavy rotation for you right now? Honestly, Brat. I\u2019m just not over it yet. I just saw Charli two nights ago in LA, and so \u2013 it\u2019s rehashing it so much. Maybe the remix album. She\u2019s a genius! She\u2019s a genius. Have you met her? No! God, I would love to. We have some mutuals so maybe some day. I just think she\u2019s the coolest person ever. And we both put out songs this year called 365 so we were swimming in the same creative pool at one point \u2026 Charli, if you\u2019re reading \u2026 Do you have a nemesis? No. I have people who wronged me, and I have people I have wronged. What\u2019s the most chaotic thing that\u2019s ever happened to you on stage? The one that just popped in my head immediately is about 10 years ago, when we were playing this venue in Zurich, Switzerland. We walked on stage to start the show, and I realised that my guitar wasn\u2019t on stage \u2013 I had changed a string and left it backstage. I went off stage to get my guitar and it was very dark. I had leant it up against a wall right behind the curtain and there was a gap between the wall and the stage that I couldn\u2019t see. So I walked really quickly to get it, and my leg fell down, and I injured myself so very badly. Totally the worst \u2013 I still have a dent in my leg from it. I got up and hobbled to the side of the stage. My sister was in the band at the time, so I waved her down and was like \u201cI need a second\u201d. I went to the green room and I screamed as loud as I could, then limped on stage and played the show, and then limped off stage and sought medical attention. My entire thigh was purple for months after that, it was really crazy. But you just get it done. What is your most used emoji? I use the monocle person a lot, and the upside down smiley face. Actually, let me look, because I want to answer this accurately. Thank you. The full moon that\u2019s making the face. I use that a lot. What\u2019s been your biggest fashion crime to date? So many. I really love to take something that is taboo and repurpose it as fashion. That\u2019s my bread and butter. I love personal style, and I love dressing loudly. I\u2019ve really, really been trying to make Uggs look chic \u2013 and they\u2019re from Australia! After a certain point in the season, I\u2019m wearing Uggs with lots of inappropriate things, lots of things that they shouldn\u2019t go with. But that\u2019s not really a crime. I don\u2019t even really believe in crimes against fashion. I love when somebody just takes a big swing. Do you want people to cry or party at your funeral? Party. Definitely. I don\u2019t want people to cry. But then \u2013 if ghosts are real and I am haunting my own, I will be upset if people aren\u2019t crying.

        "headline": "Charli xcx fans rejoice: \u2018Brat\u2019 chosen as Collins word of the year",
        "trailText": "A new definition of the word was sparked by the pop star\u2019s summer album title, and made it a term that \u2018resonated with people globally\u2019, the dictionary says",
        "bodyText": "Most have us have long moved on from \u201cbrat summer\u201d, when, sparked by Charli xcx\u2019s album of the same name, wearing slime green and embracing your inner messiness was on trend. But the lexicographers at Collins dictionary are still firmly in their brat era, naming it their 2024 word of the year. Though Collins already defined \u201cbrat\u201d as \u201csomeone, especially a child\u201d, who \u201cbehaves badly or annoys you\u201d, it has been selected as word of the year because of its new definition: \u201ccharacterised by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude\u201d. \u201c\u2018Brat\u2019 has become one of the most talked about words of 2024,\u201d Collins said. It \u201cresonated with people globally and \u2018brat summer\u2019 established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life\u201d. Brat tops a list of 10 words chosen by the dictionary publisher which represent 2024. Another pop star-inspired word made the list, \u201cera\u201d, inspired by Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cSupermajority\u201d was the only word that reflected the year\u2019s high number of elections \u2013 it apparently saw a sharp increase in usage around the time of the UK general election in July. As is often the case when it comes to words of the year, expressions popularised by social media featured heavily on the list. \u201cYapping\u201d \u2013 ie talking too much \u2013 has become a popular term on TikTok, as has \u201clooksmaxxing\u201d, defined by Collins as \u201cattempting to maximise the attractiveness of one\u2019s physical appearance\u201d. \u201cDelulu\u201d, slang for deluded, is another word known for its social media usage, along with \u201crawdogging\u201d, which originally emerged as slang for sex without a condom, but is now more widely used as a term for doing something \u2013 most commonly taking a flight or train journey \u2013 without entertainment or assistance. Meanwhile \u201cbrainrot\u201d, \u201can inability to think clearly caused by excessive consumption of low-quality online content\u201d, has also made the top 10. Completing the list are \u201canti-tourism\u201d \u2013 the opposition of large-scale tourism \u2013 and \u201cromantasy\u201d, a steamy subgenre of fantasy that has become hugely popular in recent years via authors such as Sarah J Maas and Rebecca Yarros. Alex Beecroft, managing director of Collins, said that \u201cwhile \u2018supermajority\u2019 does the heavy lifting in a year of political upheaval in the UK and around the world, the big disruptors in language have come from different sources. With many of this year\u2019s notable words being popularised by generations Z and Alpha, we can confidently say this is the most \u2018brat\u2019 word of the year list ever!\u201d Collins dictionary monitors its 20bn-word database along with a range of media sources to create an annual list that aims to \u201creflect our ever-evolving language and the preoccupations of those who use it\u201d. The words on the list tend to be a mixture of completely new words and existing terms that have been particularly notable that year \u2013 \u201clockdown\u201d was the word of the year in 2020, for example \u2013 or ones that have developed additional meanings, such as brat. Last year\u2019s word of the year was AI.",

        "headline": "Brat banking: Charli xcx takes the stage in Revolut\u2019s push to cleanse its image",
        "trailText": "Two-day bash in London was part of \u2018lifestyle brand\u2019 push to snare younger customers",
        "bodyText": "Thousands of bank customers braved the wind and rain of Storm Bert on Saturday night, forming queues that snaked through the streets surrounding London\u2019s Tottenham Court Road station. But this was no bank run. In fact, there was not a bank branch in sight. This was Revolut, Europe\u2019s most valuable fintech firm, hosting a free customer gig with one of world\u2019s biggest pop stars, Charli xcx, days before her sold-out UK arena tour. The concert by the woman whose album redefined the word brat was a flashy stunt, exhibiting the digital bank\u2019s determination to cleanse a controversy-dogged image and snare young customers, before what could be a blockbuster UK stock market float. The performance capped off a two-day Coachella-inspired party at London\u2019s subterranean Outernet venue, where 3,000 mostly fee-paying customers were treated to panels hosted by the sports pundit and prospective Match of the Day host Alex Scott; one-on-one challenges against video game streamer TenZ; and pitch sessions with Dragons Den\u2019s Steven Bartlett and Revolut\u2019s wealthy co-founder Nik Storonsky. The occasion? Revolut\u2019s celebration of reaching 50 million customers worldwide. It means the company, co-founded in 2015 by the former Lehman Brothers banker, has leapfrogged more established lenders such as HSBC, the 159-year-old bank, which has 41 million customers. Originally launched as a pre-paid card focused on free currency exchange for customers, Revolut has grown to more than 10,000 staff, serving customers in more than 36 countries, with more than 50 products and services. As well as money transfers, it offers home rentals, buy-now pay-later credit, wage advance, e-sims, and crypto trading. For those with longer memories, Revolut\u2019s two-day bash \u2013 which is understood to have cost the company upwards of \u00a31m \u2013 echoes the excesses of the banking industry in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Deutsche Bank hired singer Robbie Williams to perform for bankers at London\u2019s Equinox nightclub in 2001, before the Take That star\u2019s own European tour. \u201cIt certainly appears to be at the extravagant end of the spectrum, in a banking sector context,\u201d John Cronin, an independent banking analyst, said of the Revolut bash. However, it is also the kind of event geared at getting \u201cmaximum publicity\u201d, he added. Spending that cash on a blowout for customers, rather than its own bankers, shows how far Revolut bosses are willing to go to bolster a brand once tarnished by a string of controversies. Revolut has grappled with accounting issues and EU regulatory breaches, as well as reputational concerns, including an over-aggressive corporate culture, all of which are believed to have delayed the approval of its UK banking licence. The fintech company says it has since resolved those accounting and regulatory problems, and has made efforts to improve its working culture. After a three-year wait \u2013 and a few barbed comments aimed at regulators \u2013 Revolut finally secured the banking licence, with restrictions, in July. It will help to pave the way for the stock market listing for a company last valued at $45bn, and which politicians and the City hope will take place in London. Revolut, which is chaired by the former Standard Life Aberdeen boss Martin Gilbert, is hoping to secure a full UK banking licence by the end of 2025, opening the door to new streams of income, as it will be able to fund its own-branded loans and mortgages. In the meantime, associating Revolut with Charli xcx will broaden the bank\u2019s appeal, and shake off a stereotype as a fintech reserved for crypto bros. But bosses are also hoping that offering exclusive gigs through fee-paying accounts will bring Revolut a step closer to a much larger ambition: becoming a lifestyle brand. While that seems out of step for more traditional banks, Revolut is betting it will lure younger customers who are more interested in perks on a one-stop shop app, than previous generations who may have shopped around for marginally higher returns amid relatively low interest rates. Revolut\u2019s head of growth, Antoine Le Nel, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great way as well for us to show the value that our best plans are bringing, and how the experience ensures that Revolut is not only about managing your finances, it\u2019s about lifestyle as well. \u201cI think with this incredible experience, we offer a complete unmatched lifestyle experience. So I think the whole the halo that you [Revolut] get from it is going to be quite spectacular.\u201d Charli xcx fans who descended en masse on Saturday\u2019s event appeared to be buying the pitch. Alice and Fenya, both 18, said they were considering upgrading to a fee-paying Revolut account if it meant more gigs like these. Rob, 28 and a Monzo customer, got tickets through friends. He discovered that friends were Revolut customers. \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m missing out,\u201d he said.",

        "headline": "Saturday Night Live: Charli xcx has fun in otherwise middle of the road episode",
        "trailText": "The British star is both host and musical guest in a week that takes in everything from Trump\u2019s cabinet picks to the release of Wicked",
        "bodyText": "Saturday Night Live kicks off at the White House, where lame duck President Joe Biden (Dana Carvey) and President re-elect Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) hold a transition meeting for the press. Instead of \u201cbeing rude and crazy, like usual\u201d, Trump is doing \u201cquiet and serene, which is, in many ways, a lot scarier\u201d, while Biden, like the cartoon dog in the popular meme, claims everything is fine while ignoring the giant fire behind him. Once the press leaves, Trump brags about the cabinet he\u2019s assembling: Elon Musk and Matt Gaetz (\u201cThat\u2019s an alien v. predator\u201d), Kristi Noem and Robert F Kennedy Jr (\u201cThey\u2019re killing the dogs, they\u2019re killing the bears\u201d), and Melania (\u201cworking remotely from divorce\u201d). Sleazy creep Gaetz and grotesque wackjob RFK Jr show up, played, respectively by Sarah Sherman in giant forehead prosthetics and a gravel-voiced Alec Baldwin. Both caricatures are appropriately mean, but if the show is going to continue using them, it needs to take care not to sanitize the real people, as it has done with dangerously incompetent and malicious figures in the past, such as George W Bush or Trump himself. Musician Charli xcx pulls double duty as host and musical guest. The British superstar considers herself a triple threat, \u201cwhich, in England means I sing, I drink, and I smoke\u201d. Later, after she claims that anyone can be Brat is, former cast member Kyle Mooney shows up to prove her wrong. Mooney is a sight for sore eyes and Charlie xcx seems at ease as host. After an oddly-placed sponsored All State commercial starring the Please Don\u2019t Destroy boys, a group of gal pals surprise their pregnant bestie Kelsie (Chloe Fineman) and her long-suffering husband Matt (Andrew Dismukes) at their baby shower by singing about her many infidelities \u2013 including her continued affair with Latin lover Domingo (Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez) \u2013 to the tune of Chappell Roan\u2019s Hot to Go. I didn\u2019t think the Domingo sketch from just earlier in the season was memorable enough to bring it back so soon, but apparently it was. In my review from last week\u2019s episode, I lamented the lack of new movie parodies, so I can\u2019t really complain about a brand-new screen test sketch. This installment sees various celebs reading for parts in the upcoming Wicked adaptation. We get the return of several recurring impressions \u2013 Fineman\u2019s dire Jojo Siway, Bowen Yang\u2019s even more dire Fran Lebowitz, Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Bad Bunny, Devon Walker\u2019s Shannon Sharpe \u2013 as well as new ones, such as Sherman\u2019s very good Bernie Sanders, Carvey\u2019s just okay Al Pacino, and Fineman\u2019s Martha Stewart and Leslie Mann (credit where it\u2019s due, her Mann is on point). Charlie xcx plays Adele, as well as Troye Sivan (SNL just keeps having people play this guy, even though no viewer over 25 has any idea who he is). This is followed by the third recurring sketch, this time a Thanksgiving episode of The Food Network\u2019s baking championship. The collection of cakes is the expected horror show: the first is just stupid looking, the second is a overly sexual, stuffing spewing nightmare, and the third is so competent its boring. The best is saved for last, when Mooney\u2019s contestant proudly displays his turkey cake made from dark chocolate and a \u201cnine-inch dildo\u201d. We are then treated to a new musical Digital Short from Andy Samberg. He plays a suburban homeowner who loves nothing more than to snitch on his fellow whites, calling the cops on any Caucasian who steps foot on his lawn, be they old lady, a girl scout, or Colin Jost. Charlie xcx gets in on the action as his proud Karen of a wife. Not as funny or outrageous as bathroom sushi from earlier this season, but legitimately catchy. Banger Boyz is a podcast hosted by three would-be alpha males. They discuss Trump\u2019s recent appearance on their show, in between sponsored ads for the likes of Warm Plunges and Pube Whacker. Trump calls in from Mar-a-Lago to appoint one of the Banger Boyz Secretary of Commerce (\u201cI think it means he\u2019s charge of all the commercials\u201d) and another ambassador to Iran. The glut of moronic, Roganesque dude-bro podcasts are long overdue for mocking, but this one is toothless. Weekend Update follows Charli xcx\u2019s first musical performance. Colin Jost and Michael Che cover the same ground as the cold open, reporting on Trump\u2019s clown car cabinet picks of Matt Gaetz (\u201cHe said the same thing he says when he sees a teenage girl: I\u2019ll do it\u201d), Musk (\u201cYou can\u2019t be surprised that the white African guy\u2019s first idea is slavery\u201d), and RFK Jr (\u201cThe first brain worm survivor nominated to a cabinet-level position\u201d). More of this level of viciousness, please. Their first guest is animal wrangler and incarcerated would-be murderer Joe Exotic (Yang). He proclaims his innocence (\u201cAll I did was take care of my cats, make love to my two straight husbands, and try to kill Carole Baskin multiple times\u201d), and appeals to Trump for a pardon and position as director of Fish and Wildlife, all while getting mauled by one of his tigers. Yang\u2019s impression is solid, although the regrettable Tiger King phenomenon deserves to be memory-holed. Later, Jost brings on Sherman as Hazel, the widow of social media squirrel star Peanut, recently euthanized after biting a police officer. Dressed in a giant squirrel costume, Sherman is a ball of manic energy. The squirrel puns (\u201c[Peanut] stuffed his cheeks on OnlyFans \u2013 both sets\u201d) are funny, but the best bits are when she goes after Jost: \u201cCan you imagine if they chopped off your penis every time you tested positive for chlamydia, Colin?\u201d Their chemistry remains the best of any cast members on the show. Charli xcx performs her second set. Then it\u2019s time for the It Girl Thanksgiving special, hosted by Marc Jacobs (Yang) and Julia Fox (Fineman). Their dinner table is filled by the glamorous likes of Naomi Campbell (Ego Nwodim), Victoria Beckham (Charli xcx), Rachel Sennott (Sherman), the Olsen twins (Ashley Padilla, Jane Wickline), Cher (Heidi Gardner), and Law Roach (Kenan Thompson). There are a few okay bits throughout \u2013 Campbell bringing The Substance to dinner, the Olsen\u2019s getting lost in their \u201cbig ass coat\u201d, but for the most part this is sloppy and annoying. The final sketch of the night sees a group of friends hooking up with Shrek prior to and following a performance of Shrek the Musical. Charli xcx walking out of the theater with a bunch of green paint around her mouth is one of the show\u2019s better sight gags of late. This was a mostly middle of the road episode, which still made for a huge improvement on last week. Charli xcx was a game host, although the biggest highlights came from returning stars Baldwin, Mooney, Samberg, and Carvey (who might as well be a full time cast member at this point). It\u2019s starting to feel a little more like a proper 50th season. Now that the election is over and done with, perhaps SNL will dedicate more time to recognizing and celebrating that milestone.",

        "trailText": "In this week\u2019s newsletter: After a year packed full of content, I\u2019ve picked my favourite shows, films, records, podcasts and books for you to feast on",
        "bodyText": "2024, then. It\u2019s time to look back at a year of podcast bros, Brats and Baby Reindeer with the Guide\u2019s annual roundup. As ever, for an exhaustive rundown of what was good culturally this year, do check out the Guardian\u2019s lists of the best films (both in the UK and US), TV shows, albums (across rock and pop, folk, jazz and classical), games, art and architecture, and theatre, comedy and dance. The Guide\u2019s list doesn\u2019t pretend to be that definitive. Instead, we\u2019re sharing a smattering of our favourites, unranked. How did the year pan out? Well, the film world might not have witnessed a Barbenheimer-sized cultural event in 2024, but there were plenty of box office success stories: notably Dune: Part Two, Deadpool and Wolverine, Inside Out 2 and Wicked. As that list suggests, sequels were the dominant mode as a panicky Hollywood stuck to tried and trusted ideas \u2013 though that old safe bet, the superhero movie, continued to generally struggle this year. In music, 2024 was a year where female-fronted pop reigned. Taylor Swift managed to extend her omnipresence for a second year with the Asian and European legs of her Eras tour, not to mention her latest carnival of score-settling and self-reflection in The Tortured Poets Department. Meanwhile, Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan made their own plays for world domination. And 15 years and six albums into her career, Charli xcx finally became the ubiquitous, commercially massive yet creatively daring dance-pop phenom she always threatened to be, with Brat. British TV and its stars seemed to have an outsized influence over 2024\u2019s small-screen output, with the buzziest shows \u2013 Baby Reindeer, Industry, Sh\u014dgun \u2013 either British made, British set or featuring British stars. Of course, the truth behind this homegrown triumph was a little murkier, as Rachel Aroesti\u2019s piece for the Guardian on the US money flooding into UK shows illustrated. Generally though, this felt like a pleasingly deep-benched year for TV: when a show as admired as The Bear \u2013 for all the imperfections of its third series \u2013 can only sneak in at number 27 on our 2024 top 50, you know that the medium is in good health. Here, then, are the shows, films, albums, podcasts and books the Guide enjoyed this year. *** Film Boy, has this year felt long! But if you are able to cast your frazzled mind back to January, you\u2019ll remember that some truly fine films hit UK cinemas around then. Andrew Haigh\u2019s spectral family drama All of Us Strangers and The Zone of Interest, Jonathan Glazer\u2019s chilling Holocaust movie, certainly lingered in the memory. Other crackers from that period included Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s twisted comedy Poor Things, and Alexander Payne\u2019s The Holdovers, a film that really deserves to be on heavy rotation among households this Christmas. That last trio all picked up baubles at this year\u2019s Oscars, and there are similar expectations for Sean Baker\u2019s Anora (above), a film well-deserving of its best picture frontrunner status. Likely to dominate in the craft section of the awards is Dune: Part Two, the year\u2019s most audacious blockbuster, though I\u2019m a little confused by the lack of buzz around Alex Garland\u2019s Civil War, a bracing slap to the face of a film. Rebel Ridge, meanwhile, was the year\u2019s best thriller, a sharp exploration of race and policing in America disguised as a taut, visceral revenge drama \u2013 though one, remarkably, where very little claret was spilt. All We Imagine as Light, Payal Kapadia\u2019s beautiful tale of three nurses navigating political currents in Mumbai, was perhaps the year\u2019s most admired international film, even as it was under-appreciated by some in Kapadia\u2019s home country. Kneecap, the mock-origin story of the Irish rap group, was a complete hoot, every scene brimming with energy and humour. And Robot Dreams, about the relationship between an anthropomorphic dog and his robot companion in NYC, was the best animated film of the year. Finally, a word for Union, a terrific documentary about hard-fought attempts to get worker recognition at an Amazon warehouse, which earned a spot on the Oscar best documentary shortlist despite no one being willing to distribute the film. It offers an always timely reminder of the importance of organised labour and why the rights won through it shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted. *** Music It\u2019s hard to look past Charli xcx\u2019s Brat as the commercial and critical triumph of the year. Its influence was felt far and wide, from dancefloors to campaign rallies, but at heart it was just a really well-put-together dance pop album chocked full of tunes and attitude. Also at the sharp end of the charts, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s GNX served a buoyant lap of honour for a rapper that definitely proved his top dog status in 2024, while Tyler, the Creator\u2019s Chromakopia was the most exciting \u201cmature\u201d album you\u2019re ever likely to hear, a riot of ideas and sounds. Similarly playful was the self-titled debut album by dance pranksters Two Shell, who also managed to entertain almost as much in their interviews as on record. I still can\u2019t quite get my head around the rise of Fontaines DC, from diffident Dublin post-punkers to an act that can headline parks and arenas, but their fourth album Romance felt stadium-sized in the best possible way. I\u2019m hoping that Nil\u00fcfer Yanya (above) is on a similar trajectory \u2013 the London songwriter\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, was a terrific piece of restless indie soul. Diamond Jubilee, the streaming-eschewing marvel by mysterious lo-fi artist Cindy Lee, was the year\u2019s most welcome musical surprise, while MJ Lenderman\u2019s Manning Fireworks signalled the arrival of a major figure in indie rock. And Only God Was Above Us reminded us that Vampire Weekend are top of the class when it comes to effortless genre experimentation. I\u2019m sure that plenty will run a mile from music on the heavier end of the scale, but there were some great examples of it this year, from sludge metallers Chat Pile\u2019s howling, despairing Cool World, to the invigorating, intense post-hardcore of Deep Sage by Florida quartet Gouge Away. And at the complete opposite end of the decibel scale, I was totally entranced by 22\u00b0 Halo\u2019s Lily of the Valley, a whisper-quiet indie album about the emotional weight of a cancer diagnosis that still somehow managed to be funny and earwormy. *** TV Two shows, for my money, stood above the rest this year: Sh\u014dgun (Disney+), above, and Industry (BBC iPlayer). The former was the first truly engrossing TV epic since Game of Thrones ended, presenting an authentic, lived-in feudal Japanese world that you wanted to return to again and again. And the latter stepped up massively in its third season for what was already one of the best shows on TV, every episode seeming bigger and braver than the last, culminating in a finale that seemed to elicit a \u201cwait, what?!\u201d every few minutes. I have to hand it to Netflix. So often criticised as a streamer that seems to aim for the lowbrow and undemanding, this year they promoted a host of distinctive voices and were rewarded with some terrific TV. Complicated ethical questions will continue to swirl around Baby Reindeer, but it remains a gripping, highly original comedy drama, while Ripley was the most gorgeous-looking show of the year, and One Day managed to live up to its truly beloved source material. And that\u2019s without mentioning Supacell, Black Doves, season two of The Diplomat and many more besides. A dynamite year for British TV continued with the deliciously moreish Rivals on Disney+ and a rollicking season of Slow Horses on Apple TV+. Mr Bates v the Post Office might have been a solid, if not spectacular, primetime ITV drama, but it\u2019s impossible not to be stirred by the real-world change it affected, while the BBC delivered blue-chip television with Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light. Elsewhere, an exciting new comedy voice came of age in the form of Julio Torres, with his fantastically weird Fantasmas (Now), while the great docu-comedy How To With John Wilson landed the plane with a terrific third and final season. Finally, a word for BBC\u2019s Olympics coverage \u2013 a perfectly executed parallel bars act that somehow managed to give viewers what they wanted despite no longer having the endless red button coverage to rely on. Roll on LA 2028! *** Podcasts The year\u2019s blockbuster was undoubtedly Kill List. Its premise alone \u2013 a journalist comes into the possession of the contents of a murder-for-hire website, and tries to tip off potential targets \u2013 had you reaching for the play button. But this was no mere tawdry true-crime pod \u2013 instead it was a thoughtful (though still engrossing) deep dive into the troubling world of the dark web. It was a busy year for Serial productions, which produced both The Good Whale (above), a enjoyable series about the campaign to free the real-life orca from Free Willy, and also a fourth series proper of Serial, this time about the troubling legacy of Guant\u00e1namo Bay. And Cover: Stakeknife was a gripping, stomach-churning account of the notorious IRA enforcer-slash-British agent. I continue to be consistently delighted by Decoder Ring, Willa Paskin\u2019s Slate podcast about peculiar cultural mysteries, which this year looked into everything from the decreasing heat of the jalape\u00f1o to the social history of garden gnomes. Blank Cheque with Griffin &amp; David, the long-running pod breaking down directors\u2019 filmographies, had a great year with seasons on John McTiernan and David Lynch (it\u2019s the rare pod that gets a pass for having extremely looooong episodes). Sam Diss\u2019s pod The English Disease was a brilliant, often bracing look at 21st-century football hooliganism and its connection to this summer\u2019s riots. Of course, the Guardian has its own terrific stable of pods. Black Box was a remarkable look at the ways that AI is already interacting with humanity, for good or ill. Daily news podcast Today in Focus was indispensable on events global and local (its breathless election-night instalment was a particular highlight) while Politics Weekly and Politics Weekly America offered invaluable insight on two seismic votes across the world in 2024. There were new seasons too of Pop Culture with Chant\u00e9 Joseph and Comfort Eating with Grace Dent. And Football Weekly and Women\u2019s Football Weekly were great on tackling the major issues in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games \u2013 but also in simply offering up engaging, funny nattering, which is ultimately what we\u2019re after from a podcast, really. For a full rundown of the year\u2019s best podcasts, make sure to head over to the Guardian site on Christmas Eve, where you\u2019ll find a definitive top 20. *** Books Every year people like to squabble about the Booker longlist, but most seemed to agree that 2024\u2019s was a pretty solid list: the winner, Orbital by Samantha Harvey, is a gem of a book. Percival Everett\u2019s reimagining of Huckleberry Finn, James, or Rachel Kushner\u2019s Creation Lake (which I heard someone describe as \u201cYuval Noah Harari\u2019s Sapiens meets Killing Eve\u201d), would have also made worthy prize-winners. Personally, I had a soft spot for Rita Bullwinkel\u2019s longlisted debut, Headshot, a sharp, touching novel focused around a fictional boxing tournament. One of the most anticipated books of the year was Intermezzo by Sally Rooney, the Normal People author\u2019s fourth novel. I didn\u2019t get on with her third, Beautiful World, Where Are You?, so I didn\u2019t have high hopes for this one, but after a slow start I really got behind the characters. It\u2019s probably the author\u2019s most sophisticated and experimental novel yet. (My order of preference now goes Conversations with Friends, Intermezzo, Normal People, BWWAY \u2013 fight me.) Ali Smith\u2019s latest, Gliff, is \u2013 like all her novels \u2013 a work of art, while Miranda July\u2019s All Fours is bizarre and brilliant \u2013 and probably the book I\u2019ve heard people drop into conversations the most this year. And in nonfiction, Naomi Klein\u2019s Doppelganger came out in paperback in 2024, and is an insightful, important study of truth in politics that also manages to be hopeful \u2013 a must-read. Finally, the cookbook of the year has to be Meera Sodha\u2019s Dinner \u2013 the recipes are quicker and easier than in her previous books, and every single one I\u2019ve tried is delicious. A particular shoutout to the baked butter paneer, which I\u2019m planning to make for just about everyone who comes round to mine next year.

        "trailText": "The Drain Gang rapper\u2019s party lifestyle almost ended in disaster. Now, alongside a guest spot on Brat, Sweden\u2019s dark icon is back with a furious and euphoric new sound",
        "bodyText": "As one quarter of the Swedish underground-ish rap collective Drain Gang, Bladee (pronounced Blade) spent his 20s on the frontlines of a hyper-online youth culture. But as his 30th birthday loomed, the musician born Benjamin Reichwald started to sweat. His anxiety about ageing, a serious depressive spell, and the mixed reception to his latest album, spiralled into a crisis: were he and his Drain Gang peers \u201cpermanently frozen as 20-year-olds because we came up at a certain time of our lives\u201d, he wondered. Was he already past it at 29? \u201cI got so old, I got embarrassed to be even here,\u201d Reichwald sings on his newest album, Cold Visions. Older readers may roll their eyes, but given Reichwald has built up one of the most ardent young fanbases in music, this was a valid worry. \u201cI had a lot to get off my chest,\u201d he says now. \u201cI was thinking a lot about my position and I felt stuck \u2013 do I have to be perceived as an artist to feel fulfilled? I\u2019m chasing that and it doesn\u2019t give me anything. So why am I doing this?\u201d Reichwald has a reputation for being elusive (this is one of the very few solo interviews he has ever done) and frequently obscures his face. Lately he has favoured corpse paint, blood-red grills for his teeth and a chaotic assemblage of bandanas, sunglasses and Oakley hats. But during a two-hour conversation in a Brooklyn hotel room, in Gucci sneakers and a T-shirt with the logo of Norwegian black metal band Satyricon, he is thoughtful and forthcoming. Despite his worries, being 30 has treated Reichwald well. In March he released Psykos, a rock-leaning collaboration with his fellow Swedish rapper and long-term friend and collaborator Yung Lean, who also featured on Cold Visions, which was released the following month. In October, they both appeared on Charli xcx\u2019s Brat remix album, with Bladee reworking the song Rewind. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bladee verse, I did my thing,\u201d is how he modestly describes his contribution, but he speaks more effusively of Charli: \u201cI have eternal respect for her. She put me in this context with all these other people\u201d \u2013 Ariana Grande, Lorde and Billie Eilish all appear on the remix record \u2013 \u201cand I\u2019m very grateful to be involved.\u201d It caps a big year for Reichwald. Released a decade after his debut mixtape, Cold Visions is his most fully realised project yet. Made in two weeks in his house in Stockholm, the album is, he says, \u201creally honest, more like a diary\u201d. In the course of 30 songs, he purges his demons over raging, blown-out trap beats. Brain cells fried into oblivion, he navigates panic attacks and self-loathing, calls himself \u201cthe king of nothing matters\u201d and raps about \u201cviolently drug abusing weed\u201d. In one line he\u2019s working out and getting tanned in LA, the next \u201cI\u2019m crashing down some like a wave over castles made of sand.\u201d Cold Visions was self-released after Reichwald split from Year0001, Drain Gang\u2019s longtime label and management company. \u201cI don\u2019t really care any more about being a bigger artist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s important is that I\u2019m doing something that\u2019s true to me.\u201d The Drain Gang collective \u2013 Bladee, Ecco2K, Thaiboy Digital, and Whitearmor \u2013 have been best friends since their teens, playing around with Auto-Tune, and freestyling in the vein of idiosyncratic US rappers such as Lil B and Chief Keef. Early Bladee tracks \u2013 overcast cloud rap about crushed hearts, pills and dreams \u2013 were so digitally processed that they passed through the uncanny valley and ended up somewhere strangely melodic and emotive. \u201cI hated to hear my voice without the Auto-Tune,\u201d Reichwald says. \u201cIt\u2019s how we found our sound. Without it we wouldn\u2019t have committed to doing it \u2013 it sounded too bad.\u201d The group cycled through a number of names before landing on Drain Gang, inspired by a nihilistically gothic sentiment later articulated in Bladee\u2019s song Be Nice 2 Me: \u201cTake a knife and drain your life.\u201d They quickly found kindred spirits in Sad Boys, a local crew featuring Yung Lean. In 2014, Lean\u2019s melancholic and memeable hip-hop was taking the internet by storm, and Reichwald quit his job at a kindergarten to join him on tour. By April 2015, barely out of his teens, Reichwald was living with Lean in Miami, where working on music came second to partying and drug use. One evening, Lean suffered drug-induced psychosis; Reichwald called the ambulance which probably saved his life. Hours later, Barron Machat, Lean\u2019s 27-year-old manager, died in a car accident on his way to the hospital; Xanax was found in his system. \u201cThings were building to a point where something was going to happen because of how we were living,\u201d Reichwald says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think that anything could go wrong, we were so in this drugs and rock star lifestyle. Someone was probably always gonna die with how we were moving. It was very reckless, but we were so young, we just didn\u2019t know.\u201d Reichwald returned to Sweden and worked at a shampoo factory while suffering from PTSD and struggling to process Machat\u2019s death and Lean\u2019s deteriorating mental health. \u201cI was not really OK,\u201d he says. Reichwald says it took him a long time to understand that he and his friends had autonomy over their surreal new lives as successful rappers. \u201cI sometimes felt like, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be here, so I have to do what everyone says.\u2019 I didn\u2019t understand that I had any value in the situation. I didn\u2019t understand why people would like my music. I thought there must be some kind of misunderstanding. But now, I\u2019ve done it for so long and I actually know what I\u2019m doing. I believe more in my ability.\u201d His music remained dark and dissociative for a good while, but the clouds began to part around 2020. While Reichwald\u2019s persona had long swung between mall rat and mystic, his spiritual side became more pronounced as his music grew brighter. Fans started to wonder if he had experienced some sort of transformative near-death experience because, in 2019, he had mentioned that he\u2019d been struck by lightning in Thailand. Or at least he thinks that\u2019s what happened. \u201cEither I had a random seizure from seeing the lightning or I got struck by it.\u201d Whatever it was, \u201csomething definitely changed around that time\u201d. Drain Gang\u2019s angst once enticed a considerable number of nihilistic, male online edgelords, but their fanbase has evolved as their music has become more euphoric, frequently going viral on TikTok during the pandemic. Most of the crowd at a recent show were dressed in distressed black clothes like Reichwald; they were mainly so young that fans older than 26 were given their own fast-track queue as if they needed elderly care. Reichwald says that he is uncomfortable with being idolised, but understands the way that belonging to a subculture can be life-affirming. Even before his teens, he formed a punk band with Ecco2K after seeing someone with a studded leather jacket and thinking: \u201cI want to be like that. But,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou need to find yourself within all that.\u201d He allows himself a little pride in the way Drain Gang have built and maintained their singular corner of music. \u201cWe still don\u2019t feel like someone is doing what we\u2019re doing, better,\u201d he says. \u201cI would love to hear someone take it to the next level with a new perspective, someone young. I feel like that\u2019s the point of it \u2013 you can keep the idea going.\u201d He\u2019s now looking beyond Cold Visions to his own future. \u201cI want to become a better person,\u201d he says with a sweetly earnest laugh. \u201cI want to have a brighter outlook and work on liking myself more. I\u2019m sick of thinking about myself; I would like to be more outside my head.\u201d After several years spent getting \u201csick all the time\u201d, he is \u201ctrying to be sober and healthy\u201d. Lately he\u2019s been experimenting with songwriting in Swedish, and working on abstract paintings in his art studio. Ultimately, he finds solace in the act of creating. \u201cEven in my sadder music,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m striving for joy.\u201d \u2022 Cold Visions and Psykos are out now.

        "trailText": "Fans braved heat and high prices for Charli xcx, Lady Gaga, Megan Thee Stallion and a surprise by Queen Latifah",
        "bodyText": "Despite its reputation for bohemian escape \u2013 a music Disneyland for adults in the desert \u2013 Coachella can often feel like a gauntlet. The drive from Los Angeles to Indio will set you back anywhere from three to five hours, the lines even more; some campers endured 12-hour lines to access the site. A three-day general admissions pass went for a whopping $649 this year, $220 more than just five years ago, and that\u2019s not counting money spent on lodging, food and outfits suitable for temp swings of 40F. No wonder over half of attendees this year were on payment plans. Unless Revolve is footing your bill, what 20-something can afford Coachella? Such was the latest strain of bad press for North America\u2019s largest music festival, which \u2013 depending on who you talk to \u2013 is recovering from its flop year of depressed ticket sales in 2024. Whether the inflammatory headlines comparing it to Fyre Festival (wrong) or questioning gen Z\u2019s financial literacy (fair) are out of genuine concern or Fomo-laced schadenfreude, Coachella is certainly in some form of identity shift, with the question of who it\u2019s for, who attends and what it represents in palpable flux over the course of its first 2025 weekend. On the one hand, the festival draws a more international lineup and diverse crowd than its flower-crown reputation suggests; though it of course skews young, there were plenty of middle-aged adults (with, presumably, more robust bank accounts) mixed in with high schoolers, gaggles of shirtless men, college kids on drugs and the occasional baby with headphones on. On the other, well, it\u2019s hard to walk more than a few feet in the rapidly browning grass without either interrupting a photo or being asked to take one, the festival\u2019s appearance-oriented clientele still hopelessly tied to the \u2018gram and the game of envy. But those who did make it were rewarded by solid sets and deep dehydration \u2013 temperatures reached a scorching 102F (39C) on Friday, making 2025 the hottest festival on record. \u201cIt\u2019s hottttttttt \u2026 but it\u2019s nice\u201d rasped Djo, AKA Stranger Things\u2019 Joe Keery, on Friday afternoon in a sweltering Mojave cool kids\u2019 tent, attendees bopping to chill songs of existential ennui and anxiety while sweating through their shirts. \u201cThe weather\u2019s not like this in England, I can tell you that,\u201d lamented a miserable looking beabadoobee in the Sunday glare; the Filipino-British singer nonetheless turned out a winsome set of alt-rock shredding that recalled both Liz Phair and Michelle Branch. Good luck to anyone performing before 7pm, though the heat lent the whole affair a sense of survivors\u2019 bonding \u2013 the sight of drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool sweating off his glitter eye shadow during Green Day\u2019s Saturday night set, long after the sun went down, was perhaps the most representative image of a weekend that had many melting face. Rising temps met simmering discontent. Recession indicators abounded, from screaming to Green Day\u2019s American Idiot (\u201cI\u2019m not part of a Maga agenda,\u201d singer Billie Joe Armstrong ad-libbed), to Jimmy Eat World drenching the main stage in sweat and what is now dad rock, to Charli xcx\u2019s unofficial headliner set of pure indie sleaze. Brat green outpaced crochet on Saturday, with the British artist drawing one of the biggest crowds of the weekend to watch her stunt through bangers only with Billie Eilish, Lorde and Troye Sivan, along with numerous celebrity fans; videos circulated of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Kylie Jenner canoodling in the VIP area. Jenner\u2019s ex Travis Scott served as the semi-billed fourth headliner of the weekend, with a late Saturday set that several people I met planned to cautiously attend, citing fears about the Astroworld disaster that went unmentioned. Styled as a modern-day gladiator, attacking the beat while nearly obscured by smoke, Scott\u2019s set projected aggression without incident. Like last year, female artists saved Coachella from flopping, providing some of the biggest highs of the weekend. Charli\u2019s party-girl energy gave way to party politics, with Clairo bringing out Bernie Sanders, fresh off a Fighting Oligarchy rally in LA, as a surprise guest. Sanders called on a queer-leaning gen Z crowd to \u201clead in the fight to combat climate change, protect women\u2019s rights, and build an economy that works for all, not just the few\u201d \u2013 at a festival whose CEO has donated extensively to Republican campaigns and anti-LGBTQ+ organizations. The Go-Go\u2019s kicked off the festival with a set celebrating their 40+ years as punk leaders, proving youth is a mindset. And Lady Gaga\u2019s instantly canonical set was worth the price of admission alone, once again demonstrating Coachella\u2019s long transition into a major pop star festival in the wake of Beychella. I left my body at the sight of Gaga, haughty in queenly garb, transitioning from 2025 smash Abracadabra to 2011 hit Judas from on high. A year after Chappell Roan rocketed into the mainstream from the small Gobi stage, the South African star Tyla appeared ascendant on the Outdoor stage, holding the crowd\u2019s focus with some of the loosest hips I\u2019ve ever seen. The popheads then hustled across the grounds to Lisa \u2013 AKA Blackpink\u2019s Lalisa Manobal \u2013 at Sahara, where she cemented her solo career with a slickly produced, eardrum-puncturing set that recalled Blackpink\u2019s maximally hype headlining appearance two years ago. Her bandmate Jennie put an exclamation point on K-Pop\u2019s inroads at Coachella on Sunday, all crisp choreography and heavy beats with a cowboy hat. Megan Thee Stallion, too, went cowgirl with boots, hat and leather for indisputably the hottest dancing of the weekend. Her set delivered some of the heaviest nostalgia hits as well \u2013 during Plan B, she brought out Queen Latifah to perform U.N.I.T.Y, her 1993 track also confronting disrespect of women\u2019s bodies and choices, and Ciara to twerk for Goodies. Both incited massive crowd freak-outs, only slightly dampened by the festival cutting Megan\u2019s mic for time. And Missy Elliott melted time for her festival debut with a set that, a few technical issues aside, appealed to the past and the future at once; Get Ur Freak On and bug glasses have confirmed made it to gen Z. Nostalgia, of course, powered a good portion of a festival that depends as much on drawing the veterans as the festival bros tripping at Sahara. \u201cAs an old person I love to see how much love these old bands are getting,\u201d said a woman who appeared to be (gasp) 35 at an over-capacity crowd for Weezer\u2019s Saturday set. Basement Jaxx and Kraftwerk, both running far behind schedule at an otherwise typically tight festival, reminded why they\u2019ve long been on the Coachella lineup, back when the festival skewed heavily rock and electronic. T-Pain took attendees back to 2007 with an electrified version of Buy U a Drank that made walking through the crowd a battle against flailing limbs. Zedd portaled to 2013 with an extended version of Clarity, the high point of millennial-leaning set that brought out Maren Morris, John Mayer and Julia Michaels. Benson Boone, 22, explicitly channeling Freddie Mercury, brought out the 77-year-old Queen guitarist Brian May for Bohemian Rhapsody. And Post Malone and Shaboozey leaned into the nostalgia inherent in a country twang; the latter\u2019s voice, rich and honeyed, drew a strikingly diverse crowd for a full sing-along to A Bar Song (Tipsy), which he premiered at Coachella last year to far fewer people. For a festival that often feels too slick for its own good, there were still some surprises. The little monsters of erstwhile Nickelodeon kids\u2019 show Yo Gabba Gabba! delivered one of the most unexpectedly joyous and strange hours of the weekend \u2013 pure mascot mayhem, Duolingo owl included, for silly songs like Yummy In My Tummy, plus Weird Al and Flavor Flav for a ridiculously catchy number called I Love Bugs. That moment, vibing out to children\u2019s song about centipedes and spiders, unlocked the secret of Coachella \u2013 find whatever escape hits enough to forget the enormous start-up costs and tiers of people getting better access than you, and it\u2019s all worth it. That it took a children\u2019s show performing to a room at least 50% on drugs to find it is as good an indicator as any that Coachella is in its quarter-life crisis era, trying a little of everything, cartoon monsters to Little Monsters, to see what sticks. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2025. An earlier version identified Brian May as Queen\u2019s drummer rather than the band\u2019s guitarist.",

An artist who had previously seemed hell-bent on singlehandedly dragging pop music into a more interesting, experimental space by sheer force of will \u2013 on her acclaimed 2017 mixtape Pop 2, she collaborated with Estonian \u201cpost-Soviet\u201d rappers, Brazilian drag queens and the extravagantly foul-mouthed underground artist CupcakKe \u2013 had apparently decided not to bother any more. She gamely presented Crash as another experiment in \u201cmaking a major-label album the way it\u2019s actually done\u201d and knowingly embracing \u201ceverything that the life of a pop figurehead has to offer in today\u2019s world \u2013 celebrity, obsession and global hits\u201d, but you somehow sensed her heart wasn\u2019t quite in it. Moreover, it didn\u2019t totally work \u2013 it was well reviewed and became Charli\u2019s first UK No 1 album, but didn\u2019t exactly produce \u201cglobal hits\u201d. What Charli subsequently described as a deadening experience lit a fire under its author: if playing the game was no fun, then why not do exactly as you please? Certainly, Charli xcx\u2019s sixth album turned out to be everything Crash wasn\u2019t, up to and including the defining pop album of the year. Instead of a sleeve featuring the singer in a bikini, as Crash did, Brat came wrapped in a blunt, lowercase rendering of the album\u2019s title against a sickly lime green: intended as a snub to the \u201cmisogynistic and boring\u201d assumption that a female artist should automatically appear on her own album cover, it turned out to be a masterstroke of branding far more pervasive than any glossy photo, even influencing the US presidential race. Its sound was brash and aggressive, early 00s London club music \u2013 electroclash, acid-y bloghouse, dubstep, maximalist rave synths \u2013 shot through a chattering, trebly hyperpop filter: \u201cClub classic but I still pop,\u201d as Von Dutch put it. It oozed self-possession and confidence, Brat seemed to swagger even as Charli confessed to insecurity or inadequacy, a cocktail of emotions that seemed to be at the album\u2019s centre: if everyone feels like this, you might as well own it. It felt fundamentally honest: instead of pop\u2019s usual broad-brushstroke self-help platitudes, there was something striking about the splurge of complex, vacillating feelings regarding motherhood on I Think About It All the Time, or the mixture of admiration and resentment on Mean Girls. Most importantly, it had a surfeit of fantastic songs: Apple, Everything Is Romantic, Club Classics, So I\u2019s heartbreaking eulogy to her late collaborator Sophie. Messy, obdurate and in your face, Brat\u2019s tone struck a genuine cultural nerve. Perhaps you could have seen that coming. Over the last couple of years, a nostalgic fascination with \u201cindie sleaze\u201d \u2013 grimy, sweaty looking images of early 00s hedonism and the music that soundtracked it \u2013 seemed to indicate a longing among gen Z for a rather less straitened, watchful, self-censoring mood than that of recent years. Brat was the right album at the right time, something that other pop stars \u2013 ordinarily more commercially successful than Charli xcx \u2013 recognised: Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and Lorde all appeared on the remix album Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat, the latter on a version of Girl, So Confusing, a song about Charli xcx\u2019s fraught relationship with \u2026 Lorde. Taylor Swift, meanwhile, was apparently so rattled by Brat\u2019s arrival that she suddenly released six different deluxe editions of her album The Tortured Poets Department in order to keep it from reaching No 1 in the UK. Whether Brat singlehandedly drags pop music into a more interesting, experimental space remains to be seen. But whether you view it as zeitgeist-capturing or zeitgeist-changing feels slightly beside the point. More important is that it does everything you might conceivably want a pop album to do: it\u2019s sharp and smart, funny and moving; it\u2019s experimental and danceable; it has big tunes and depth; it sounds like now. And it\u2019s the product of a pop artist declining to chase trends, and instead just being themselves. There\u2019s a lesson in there somewhere.",

        "trailText": "Charli xcx, the Prodigy and Loyle Carner will headline the Other stage, with first-time sets from Alanis Morissette, Doechii and En Vogue",
        "bodyText": "This year\u2019s Glastonbury set will feature two first-time headliners in the British pop-rock group the 1975 and the US pop-punk songwriter Olivia Rodrigo. The band, led by Matty Healy, will top the Friday night billing on the Pyramid stage. Rodrigo will perform on Sunday. In 2022, the Drivers License singer performed on the Other stage, a set that boasted a guest spot from Lily Allen and an excoriation of the US supreme court following the overturning of Roe v Wade a day earlier. In between on Saturday comes a previously \u2013 accidentally \u2013 announced headline set from Neil Young and his band the Chrome Hearts. On 1 January, Young declared, out of the blue, that he was withdrawing from this year\u2019s festival owing to his perception that it was under broadcast partner the BBC\u2019s \u201ccorporate control\u201d. Two days later, he said he had received \u201can error in information\u201d and that the festival was \u201cback on our itinerary\u201d. He previously headlined in 2009. The soul-pop star Raye will play on the Pyramid stage before Young. The 27-year-old Londoner is already something of a national treasure after walking away from her major label to find critical and commercial success with her debut album, My 21st Century Blues. The festival previously revealed that Rod Stewart would take this year\u2019s \u201clegends\u201d slot. Stewart, who turned 80 in January, said he was \u201cmore than able to pleasure and titillate\u201d at his age. The Other stage headliners have also been revealed. After turning the world lime green with her culture-dominating album Brat last summer \u2013 and rivalling Dua Lipa\u2019s headline extravaganza with merely a DJ set at Glastonbury 2024 \u2013 Charli xcx will headline the festival\u2019s second stage on Saturday. The London rapper Loyle Carner headlines it on Friday, and the Prodigy will close the stage on Sunday \u2013 the dance group\u2019s first Glastonbury performance since the death of their frontman, Keith Flint, in 2019, just before that year\u2019s festival. A raft of talents old and new are among this year\u2019s first-time performers. At the breakout end of the scale, there is the Stick Season troubadour Noah Kahan, the That\u2019s So True songwriter Gracie Abrams, the Messy singer Lola Young, the euphoric Brits-minted star Myles Smith, the cheeky American-Ghanaian rapper Amaarae and the A Bar Song (Tipsy) star and Beyonc\u00e9 collaborator Shaboozey. There are more surprising debuts from Alanis Morissette, Busta Rhymes, Brandi Carlile \u2013 who will be fresh off the back of a duets album with Elton John \u2013 the US girl group En Vogue, Anohni and the Johnsons, the cult British funk act Cymande, the hard-touring Osees and everyone\u2019s friend electric, Gary Numan. Worthy farm stalwarts scheduled to perform include Ezra Collective \u2013 riding high off winning best group at this year\u2019s Brit awards \u2013 the Australian punk tykes Amyl and the Sniffers, Jorja Smith, Creedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s John Fogerty and the roots reggae stars Burning Spear and Black Uhuru. Friday also sees the return of the Isle of Wight indie duo Wet Leg, presumed to be back this year with their second album. The Irish pop star CMAT is another returning talent, along with the Bath dance iconoclast PinkPantheress and Sheffield\u2019s Self Esteem, who returns with her new album, A Complicated Woman, in April. After winning best rap album for her mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal at this year\u2019s Grammy awards \u2013 which also featured a performance hinting at the magic she will bring to Worthy Farm \u2013 the Florida rapper Doechii will headline the West Holts stage on Saturday. That day also sees the Glastonbury debut of Jade, formerly of the UK girl group Little Mix. She joins a well-rounded day that features the London rock duo Nova Twins and the capital-born rapper Pa Salieu, the returning Scissor Sisters and New York indie stalwarts TV On The Radio, who have received rave reviews for the 20th anniversary tour of their 2004 album Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes. On Sunday, the British indie quartet Wolf Alice mark their return, four years after their critically acclaimed third album, Blue Weekend. The Libertines \u2013 now a venerable indie institution far from their chaotic 00s heyday \u2013 lead an indie-heavy lineup that also features the resurgent Maccabees. From varying sides of the US rock firmament, St Vincent will perform songs from her 2024 album All Born Screaming, and the presence of Baltimore hardcore band Turnstile indicates that they may finally release the much clamoured-over followup to 2021\u2019s Glow On. More acts are yet to be announced in the coming months, with performances rumoured from Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and \u2013 take it with a pinch of salt \u2013 Rihanna, which seems incredibly unlikely given that the three Pyramid headliners have already been revealed. This year\u2019s festival takes place from 25 to 29 June. It will take a fallow year in 2026 to allow the farm land to rest; the last intentional one was in 2018. The festival did not take place in 2020 or 2021 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.

        "headline": "The UK may be waning as a pop superpower \u2013 but a new generation is being nurtured",
        "trailText": "No British artists were in the top 10 biggest albums and singles globally last year. But big acts were between projects, and Charli xcx and Central Cee are hitting their stride",
        "bodyText": "For decades, Britain has traditionally punched massively above its weight when it comes to pop music: we\u2019re so used to providing the world with huge stars that the sight of a list of global bestselling albums and singles that doesn\u2019t contain a single UK artist comes as a jolt. The industry body IFPI has published its figures for 2024, and these charts are populated solely by American and South Korean artists. It tells you something about a market dramatically opened up by the rise of social media and streaming, which made music from outside the old Anglo-American pop axis more accessible and appealing. Four of the 10 biggest-selling albums of 2024 come from South Korea, a country that continues to exceed expectations, with 17m fewer people than the UK. It has proved infinitely more adept at marketing manufactured pop than Britain or the US in recent years, with K-pop fans actually spending money on albums: when you remove streaming from the equation and look at pure sales, 17 of the top 20 biggest global sellers are South Korean. Sales are helped along by fan-baiting multiple editions \u2013 Seventeen\u2019s two charting albums had 12 different versions between them \u2013 though Taylor Swift was the canniest in this regard: she released a total of 36 versions (19 of them physical editions) of The Tortured Poets Department, which duly tops the global album list. The trend for country or vaguely country-influenced pop over the last 12 months means that traditional Nashville star Morgan Wallen is in both charts, as is Noah Kahan, whose woody singer-songwriter strains are distantly related to country. It\u2019s a trend that militates against British artists; we\u2019re good at many things, but country is not traditionally our forte. Furthermore, it perhaps says something about the fact that Britain hasn\u2019t produced a new mainstream pop star striking or original enough to compete outside the confines of their homeland for several years. The highest-placed UK artist on IFPI\u2019s global singles chart, at No 15, was Artemas with I Like the Way You Kiss Me, though nothing on his mix tape Yustyna came close to its success and perhaps his style is too jaded to significantly cross over: his most recent song was named after a porn site. But Raye\u2019s next album could capitalise on the critical acclaim afforded her debut in the US, while Lola Young, whose UK No 1 single Messy is currently outstreaming hits by Lady Gaga, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter globally on Spotify, could be another bright prospect. And in fairness, the IFPI list isn\u2019t the full story. The absence of British names perhaps says less about a paucity of homegrown stars than the fact that some of the country\u2019s biggest artists \u2013 Harry Styles, Adele, Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi among them \u2013 are either on hiatus from releasing new music, or in the process of working on it. Meanwhile, you could hardly accuse Charli xcx\u2019s Brat of being an album that landed with insufficient impact, even if its sales weren\u2019t enough to elevate it into the year\u2019s Top 10 biggest sellers: Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign team changed the theme of its social media accounts to mirror that of the album after the singer endorsed the presidential candidate. Outside the period covered by the list, Central Cee\u2019s debut album Can\u2019t Rush Greatness entered the US charts at No 9: nothing to give Kendrick Lamar sleepless nights, but an achievement so extraordinary, given America\u2019s traditional resistance to rap artists from outside its borders, that it would have seemed completely unimaginable even a few years ago. Tellingly, both Charli xcx and Central Cee have taken a long time to reach their commercial zenith: Brat is the former\u2019s sixth album, Can\u2019t Rush Greatness arrived nearly eight years after the latter\u2019s debut EP. There\u2019s a lesson about allowing artists to develop, rather than expecting immediate results, which perhaps the British music industry has heeded. After a period in which major labels would apparently alight on anything that had gone viral on social media, which yielded short-term success but little longevity (you may recall their brief faith in the questionable notion that sea shanties were very much the coming thing in 2020), they\u2019re currently claiming to set great store in taking a longer view when it comes to what they sign. It\u2019s the right thing to do: we\u2019ll have to wait to see if it yields results.",

        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink). Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best country solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 16 Carriages Jelly Roll \u2013 I Am Not Okay Kacey Musgraves \u2013 The Architect Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Chris Stapleton \u2013 It Takes a Woman In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "trailText": "London singer-songwriter picks up three nominations, with her collaborator Conor Dickinson earning two alongside Ghetts and Raye",
        "bodyText": "Singer-songwriter Lola Young tops the nominations for the 2025 Ivor Novello awards, which recognise the best in British and Irish songwriting and composition for the screen. She receives three nominations in her first year of recognition by the Ivors Academy: best album for This Wasn\u2019t Meant for You Anyway, best song musically and lyrically for Messy, and the rising star award. The Brit School alumna released Messy in May 2024, but after going viral on TikTok it eventually reached No 1 in January, spending four weeks at the top. Messy also topped charts in Australia, Ireland and beyond and peaked at number 14 in the US. It has been streamed more than 500m times on Spotify, with listeners drawn to Young\u2019s frank assessment of her own failings, and her compelling (and quite sweary) tale of a toxic relationship: \u201cAnd I\u2019m too perfect \u2019til I show you that I\u2019m not / A thousand people I could be for you and you hate the fucking lot,\u201d the chorus concludes. Despite the east Londoner\u2019s seemingly overnight success, she has been in the UK music scene for years, performing gigs around the capital since around 2018. Her soulful sound caught the attention of Nick Shymansky, Amy Winehouse\u2019s former manager, and Nick Huggett, who first signed Adele \u2013 the two became her managers. Her cover of Together in Electric Dreams was featured in the 2021 John Lewis Christmas advert, and she also featured on Tyler, The Creator\u2019s 2024 Chromakopia album. Young\u2019s collaborator Conor Dickinson earns two nominations for his contributions to her work. Also nominated for best song musically and lyrically is Orla Gartland with her first nomination at the awards (for Mine), Laura Marling (Child of Mine), Fontaines DC (In the Modern World) and Raye, last year\u2019s winner of songwriter of the year (Genesis). Up for best album this year alongside Young is Charli xcx for her cultural phenomenon album Brat, which reached No 1 in the UK, Australia and Ireland and No 3 in the US. It dominated summer 2024, leading to the trend of \u201cBrat Summer\u201d and a viral dance craze to its song Apple. Other best album nominees are Berwyn (for Who Am I), Jordan Rakei (The Loop) and Ghetts (On Purpose, With Purpose), the latter also nominated in the best contemporary song category for that album\u2019s Sampha collaboration, Double Standards. Rap is well represented in that category, with Pa Salieu and Bashy joining Ghetts, plus singer-songwriter Sans Soucis and pop star Jade, who won the Brit award for pop act at 2025\u2019s awards. Nominees for most performed work, acknowledging commercial success, are Harry Styles (As It Was, which won two years ago and is in its third year of nomination), Dua Lipa (Houdini), Cass\u00f6, Raye &amp; D-Block Europe (Prada), Myles Smith (Stargazing) and Wham! (Last Christmas) \u2013 21 years after George Michael was last nominated in that category. Music from The Substance, Kneecap, Rivals and The Casting of Frank Stone has been acknowledged in the film, TV and video game categories. The awards are celebrating their 70th year on 22 May at Grosvenor House in London.

        "trailText": "With nominations led by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx, the event will serve a dual-purpose by acknowledging the devastating wildfires in California",
        "bodyText": "A \u201cvery different\u201d Grammy awards will take place in Los Angeles this weekend, impacted by the recent wildfires that have affected California. The annual celebration of music, taking place at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday, will still feature a range of big-name performers but there will be a noticeable shift in purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical Grammy party atmosphere,\u201d said Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the Recording Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only \u2018the show must go on\u2019 but the show must provide a greater service. Of course, we\u2019re going to honor music, but our goal is to utilise music to make a difference.\u201d The week leading to the Grammys typically sees a string of major parties put on by record labels, but the majority have been cancelled in response to the fires, which have killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of structures. Money will instead be diverted to those in need. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\u201d Mason said. \u201cIt will honour some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d The annual tradition that will go ahead in Clive Davis\u2019s legendary gala, which takes place the night before. This year\u2019s event will also include a fundraising element. \u201cWe want to ensure that the evening will not only be a memorable night of music but will also provide impactful support for those very much in need,\u201d Davis said. This year\u2019s nominees are led by Beyonc\u00e9, whose country album Cowboy Carter brought her 11 nods, making her the most nominated artist ever alongside husband Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to win the award for album of the year and if she wins this weekend, she would be only the fourth Black woman to take it home. The star has been nominated for the award four times before. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d Jay-Z said last year on stage. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has already become the first solo Black female to top the country charts in the US and could make history if she wins in the country categories on Sunday. The singer, whose mother Tina Knowles lost a home in the fires, has donated $2.5m to relief efforts. In the category of album of the year, she faces competition from stars including Andr\u00e9 3000, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx and Taylor Swift, who won last year. Swift, who has now won 14 Grammys, has also donated to a number of wildfire funds. In an Instagram statement, urging others to also contribute, she wrote that it was \u201cheartbreaking to see the stories unfold\u201d. The singer has been confirmed to present an award on Sunday. The evening will be hosted by Trevor Noah and feature performances from multiple nominees Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter with a special tribute to the late Quincy Jones, featuring Stevie Wonder and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. \u201cIt\u2019s Grammy week,\u201d Roan wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \u201cI am very emo. My heart feels warm and fuzzy with all the support I have been given this past year. I hope you can understand that this has been incredible and scary and spiritual and confusing.\u201d The evening lands in the middle of an awards season that has seen delays and shifts as a result of the ongoing wildfires. The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and a tweaked ceremony will remove original song performances and spend more time trying to \u201cacknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires\u201d. The Critics Choice awards were also delayed until 7 February. This week also saw a benefit concert in Los Angeles with stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Joni Mitchell performing.",

        "trailText": "It was heartening \u2013 if expected \u2013 to see Beyonc\u00e9, Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx and Chappell Roan all grab gongs, while an award for the Beatles suggests confidence in AI",
        "bodyText": "Like all major awards ceremonies, the Grammys spawn a mini-industry in predictions: in the weeks before the winners are announced, a rash of articles inevitably appear in which expert voices scan the nominations and foretell who\u2019s going to win. This year, you didn\u2019t really need in-depth knowledge of the music industry or the Recording Academy\u2019s internal machinations to work out what was going to happen, unless there was a major upset. Across the previous 12 months, a succession of artists impacted in a way that pop music is no longer supposed to do. Its once-central defining role within broader popular culture is held to have been vastly diminished by social media, and yet Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us wasn\u2019t just a huge commercial success, it influenced everything, from US sports to the campaign messaging of the American presidential election to sales of the fashion brands featured in its video: if you were going to dub anything the song of the year, it was obviously going to be that. Likewise, Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, an album which caught a mood so completely, its title wound up a widely used (if nebulously defined) adjective: the notion of it ending the night unrewarded seemed fairly unthinkable (though it didn\u2019t triumph in its biggest nominated categories). Moreover, Brat was part of a noticeable shift in the tone of mainstream pop music, away from impeccably styled, media-trained, Instagram-filtered perfection towards something messier, more heartfelt and personal, a state of affairs it would have been faintly nuts for the Academy not to recognise. This wasn\u2019t merely the kind of trend that provokes think pieces from critics and ups the general quality of pop music \u2013 it was one that also sold millions of records by Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, both of whom deservedly did well on the night. Should anyone doubt that a new mood in pop is abroad, it\u2019s worth noting that Roan turned up to the ceremony wearing a wimple and drag-queen makeup and spent her acceptance speech excoriating the music industry for its unwillingness to provide young artists with a living wage in an era of record profits. You probably wouldn\u2019t have expected that from the best new artist winner a few years back, but it\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that Chappell Roan does: she\u2019s both impressively outspoken and possessed of a very original take on how a pop star should look. Elsewhere, you could certainly argue the Beyonc\u00e9 albums that failed to snare the album of the year category in previous years were qualitatively better than the album that finally won it \u2013 certainly, 2016\u2019s Lemonade and 2022\u2019s Renaissance were more consistent and conceptually more coherent \u2013 but you\u2019d be harder pushed to make a case that Cowboy Carter wasn\u2019t impactful enough. For all it seemed to tire of its Beyonc\u00e9-goes-country theme midway through, throwing in everything from hip-hop to psychedelic soul, Cowboy Carter felt of the moment. It featured Shaboozey \u2013 ahead of his single A Bar Song (Tipsy) spending a record-setting 19 weeks at the top of the US chart \u2013 and it was part of the ongoing vogue for pop artists shifting their sound towards something more country-adjacent, unencumbered by the kind of this-isn\u2019t-country dismissal from Nashville that famously dogged Lil Nas X\u2019s similarly successful Old Town Road five years ago. Indeed, the closest the Grammys came to controversy \u2013 aside from awards for Chris Brown and Dave Chappelle, and a provocative appearance by Kanye West and his wife \u2013 was when it seemed most traditional, handing out the best rock performance gong to the Beatles for Now and Then. You could view that as merely an act of sentiment \u2013 Now and Then was, after all, dubbed \u201cthe last Beatles single\u201d, a final leave-taking from the biggest band of all time \u2013 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that it was a rock performance that required AI to make it happen, previous attempts at extracting a usable vocal from John Lennon\u2019s unfinished 1977 demo having failed because the equipment wasn\u2019t up to it. The rights and wrongs of using AI in music have been hotly debated and one way you could read Now and Then\u2019s success is as a tacit thumbs-up from the music business for a deeply divisive technology, or at least a hopeful suggestion that it might be a wonderful tool rather than a catastrophe for creativity. You have to admire their optimism.",

        "trailText": "Pop may be full of solo artists and individually tailored streams, but the Eras tour, Brat summer and Oasis reunion showed we still long to be part of a crowd",
        "bodyText": "The past year brought with it intriguing musical movements, not least a sudden pivot towards country by a succession of mainstream pop stars. Heralded by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Carter album and amplified by the release of Post Malone\u2019s F-1 Trillion, the trend also brought huge hits for the hitherto-unknown Shaboozey and Dasha, while Zayn Malik called on the services of a Nashville producer and Lana Del Rey announced a country-influenced album. 2024 also brought with it new stars, most obviously Chappell Roan, who had spent the best part of a decade plugging away in obscurity, being signed then dropped by a major label, before releasing a debut album that slow-burned its way to the top of the charts: The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess initially came out in 2023 to little response (one of its biggest hits, Pink Pony Club, was first released four years ago). As with Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 whose 2024 breakthrough Short N\u2019 Sweet was her sixth album \u2013 Roan had clearly had the space to work out exactly what she wanted to do and how she wanted to present herself, with appealingly idiosyncratic and uncontrived results. But the most striking thing about pop in 2024 was the way it was dominated by a handful of huge, monocultural stories, which spilled out of the music pages into the mainstream news agenda. Continuing from 2023, Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour began the year being described as bigger than the Beatles and Thriller by support act Phoebe Bridgers and ended it officially the highest-grossing tour in history, making Swift a billionaire in the process. By the time it arrived in the UK this summer, the clamour made it impossible to avoid. But it was superseded in the headlines by the release of Charli xcx\u2019s Brat and the announcement we were living through a \u201cBrat summer\u201d: whatever the rather nebulous concept of being \u201cbrat\u201d signified, the idea took dramatic hold, turning up everywhere from the US election campaign to the New Statesman\u2019s posthumous appreciation of Edna O\u2019Brien and the pages of National Geographic, which proclaimed Cleopatra, Lucrezia Borgia and 7th-century Chinese empress Wu Zetian were all \u201cbrat\u201d. Then Oasis announced their 2025 reunion tour. For weeks, it was unavoidable: loud and lengthy expressions of joy; equally loud and lengthy expressions of horror; controversy regarding ticket prices; rosy-hued 90s nostalgia; bitter recriminations regarding the failings of 90s pop culture; and explorations of the curious phenomenon of teenagers too young to remember Oasis\u2019s 2009 split, let alone their golden years, yet apparently thrilled by their reappearance. On the face of it, these three mega-stories were all quite different. The Eras tour had a sense of finality \u2013 it was difficult for even the most hysterical devotee to see how Swift could possibly top this career-summarising greatest hits show. The success of Brat, meanwhile, seemed to herald a new era in mainstream pop that was messier, brasher, wittier and wilfully trashier, a reaction to years of self-help platitudes, wellness culture and perfectly choreographed pop. (You could see something similar in Roan\u2019s drag-inspired aesthetic \u2013 the cover of her single Good Luck, Babe! had her sporting a prosthetic pig\u2019s snout \u2013 and in Carpenter\u2019s gleefully acidic lyrics.) At the risk of sounding like the writer trying to crowbar Charli xcx into a piece about Edna O\u2019Brien, one could argue the V-flicking Gallaghers are, well, brat; if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to wellness culture and self-care bromides, they\u2019ve got a song called Cigarettes and Alcohol that\u2019s very much in favour of both. But their reunion was still predicated on nostalgia, with even teenage fans buying into a myth of the 90s as a kind of prelapsarian age, before social media and smartphones, that was less fraught than the present day. And yet, all three stories had something in common. For years now, pop has favoured the individual over the collective \u2013 this year groups such as Flo have continued to struggle, and some of the biggest global hits were from newly solo K-pop stars such as Jimin of BTS and Ros\u00e9 and Lisa of Blackpink \u2013 and the way pop is consumed has also narrowed. Streaming\u2019s algorithms serve up music ostensibly tailored to your own personal tastes. The price of tickets has turned gig-going into a special occasion you indulge in once or twice a year rather than enjoy on a regular basis. Fandoms have become weird, often troubling things that seem to exist as disembodied online entities firing pissy, anonymous social media messages to their idol\u2019s rivals. The things music fans used to gather around \u2013 TV and radio shows, the music press, even the charts \u2013 are either fading in importance or essentially defunct. Yet there remains an innate desire for collective experience, for music to provide a sense of community. You could see it in the burgeoning popularity of dance music: a DJ like Sammy Virji may have made little impact on the charts, but he can still sell out two nights at Brixton Academy; the nocturnal dance events at Glastonbury were so over-subscribed, some had to be closed down due to overcrowding. You could see it in the crowds that flocked to the Eras gigs, who seemed noticeably different from other pop audiences, and were big on intriguingly homespun rituals \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if Swift or her management had told them to come in costume, or trade friendship bracelets, or draw the number 13 on their hands, or develop a series of if-you-know-you-know responses to particular moments in certain songs. You could see it in a willingness to buy into the notion of Brat and Brat summer, a way of defining yourself, however nebulously, through music in a post-tribal era, when pop is supposed to have lost its ability to affect the way its audience defines itself. And you could see it in the commotion caused by the return of Oasis. Whatever else you make of it, Oasis\u2019s oeuvre is absolutely predicated on collective experience: their songs sound like songs written specifically for vast crowds of people to bellow along to en masse; they\u2019re probably best experienced in the middle of said crowd, drunk, with your arms around your friends. Indeed, collective experience is so entrenched in Oasis\u2019s appeal that their music has literally become a signifier of it. In recent years, advertisers have reached for Stand By Me and Round Are Way in commercials tagged, respectively \u201cit\u2019s a people thing\u201d and \u201cwe can all do our bit for our community\u201d. So perhaps that\u2019s the underlying message of pop in 2024: people still want to be part of something bigger than themselves, and they\u2019ll still use pop to do it, even in an age when audiences are supposed to be atomised and individually sated by the algorithm. If it is, that\u2019s a hopeful note to end a frequently hopeless year on.",

        "trailText": "Americana\u2019s classiest duo weather the storm, Kendrick Lamar has the last word, UK jazz soars \u2013 and Charli xcx unleashes the power of Brat",
        "bodyText": "1. Gillian Welch &amp; David Rawlings: Woodland (Acony, August) Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\u2019s return was prompted by the near loss of their life\u2019s work when a hurricane damaged Woodland, the folk duo\u2019s recording studio. That averted destruction was mirrored in these beautifully arranged, woebegone tales of empty freight trains and departed friends. 2. Jpegmafia: I Lay Down My Life for You (Awal, August) How to follow Scaring the Hoes, Jpegmafia\u2019s 2023 caustic outing with Danny Brown? With this dizzying collision of hooks, samples, metal guitars and disdain. Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks\u2019s uranium-tongued collection found space for self-reflection too. 3. Charli xcx: Brat (Atlantic, June) Pop\u2019s premier left-field auteur finally received her mainstream kudos thanks to this inescapable album-cum-phenomenon. This acid green collection of 15 dancefloor-facing tracks (and its starry remix album) threw out attitude and vulnerability in heroic succession. 4. Shabaka: Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace (Impulse!, April) Flutes have had a resurgence, thanks to erstwhile OutKast rapper Andre 3000 in 2023 and Shabaka Hutchings, whose saxophone has had an outsized impact on the last decade of hip UK jazz. This very personal outing on shakuhachi (Japanese flute) and clarinet indicated that serenity comes from blowing up your USP. 5. Floating Points: Cascade (Ninja Tune, September) Sam Shepherd\u2019s last opus was 2021\u2019s Promises, featuring the LSO and the last recordings of Pharoah Sanders. Recorded during downtime from scoring a ballet, Cascade marked a return to slapping club music, a gossamer set that reaffirmed this polymath\u2019s dancefloor prowess. 6. Kim Deal: Nobody Loves You More (4AD, November) Pixies bassist, Breeders mainstay, Olivia Rodrigo inspirer and now solo artist Kim Deal took 12 years to make this album, which also featured her ally, late engineer Steve Albini. Few artists can meld pop sweetness and gnarly guitar as sublimely as Deal, whose songs spanned everything from her mother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s to disobedience. 7. Cassie Kinoshi\u2019s Seed: Gratitude (International Anthem, March) Of all the terrific UK jazz records this year \u2013 pace, Nala Sinephro, Ezra Collective and Nubya Garcia \u2013 this outing from composer Cassie Kinoshi departed furthest from her Tomorrow\u2019s Warrior peers. Mostly recorded live with her 18-piece ensemble, Seed, plus strings from the London Contemporary Orchestra, Gratitude was a sweeping, old-school orchestral score emphasising self-care. 8. Sophie: Sophie (Transgressive/Future Classic, September) Hyperpop producer Sophie\u2019s third album was almost finished when she tragically fell to her death in 2021. Completed by her brother, Sophie captures an artist working on the cusp of punishing experimentation and out-and-out pop. What Sophie might lack in cohesion it makes up in singular sound design and eclectic self-assurance. 9. Kendrick Lamar: GNX (PGLang/Interscope, November) Pulitzer prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar has long struggled with fame and his place in hip-hop\u2019s pantheon. His war of words with Drake this summer seemed to settle the matter, making GNX an erudite flex that leaned hard on bopping productions and retro samples while retaining all the rigour of Lamar\u2019s dense, deep-dive lyricism. 10. Shovel Dance Collective: The Shovel Dance (American Dreams, October) A number of silvery artists have reinvented folk of late; the nine-person British experimental Shovel Dance Collective are another revelation. Traditionals such as The Merry Golden Tree revisited the story of a betrayed cabin boy with tensile emotion and minimal drones while Four Loom Weaver was a portrait of grinding poverty rendered in breathtaking a cappella.",

        "trailText": "Charli xcx covered in red wine, Anna Sorokin in an ankle tag on Dancing with the Stars \u2013 it has been 12 months marked by chaos, indulgence and mess, says Guardian deputy Opinion editor Kirsty Major",
        "bodyText": "If culture is the mirror that reflects the state of society, right now we\u2019re all looking a little dishevelled \u2013 and struggling to find the energy to care. The signs have been there for a while, with rumblings initially picked up by trend forecasters\u2019 finely tuned cultural seismometers. In 2021, Sean Monahan coined the term \u201cthe vibe shift\u201d in his Substack to explain the transition from the self-controlled, self-improvement-obsessed worthiness of the 2010s to the messy decadence of the 2020s. Three years later, it feels like that earthquake has finally hit. The text of the year was, of course, the album Brat by Charli xcx, and the image that summed it all up was from the lead single\u2019s music video: the pop star pouring a glass of red wine while standing on a vibrating power plate, spilling it down her white T-shirt and staring defiantly into the camera. In the background, actor Rachel Sennott scrolls on her phone on an exercise ball and actor and model Julia Fox vapes while curling a dumbbell. If not dancing, this is casually leaning on the grave of wellness culture. The message is: \u2018\u201cIt\u2019s OK to be a bit messy, physically and mentally, and let\u2019s have a good time while we\u2019re at it.\u201d While accepting a prize at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Innovator awards, the musician said: \u201cLuckily for me, the pendulum of culture swung in favour of messiness, personality and the niche.\u201d In fashion, Miu Miu\u2019s spring collection featured stuffed and overflowing bags, and on Balenciaga\u2019s autumn runway, labels stuck out of the models\u2019 clothes. Successful advertising these days, according to brand strategy consultant Eugene Healey, is chaotic and entertaining. In a TikTok post, he said: \u201cIf brands are still going to sell me something I don\u2019t need, at least make a spectacle out of it.\u201d Long gone are the days of earnest and minimal millennial advertising such as Airbnb promising us we could \u201cBelong Anywhere\u201d. Along with the chaos, there is also indulgence, perhaps a symptom of our cultural long Covid \u2013 the excess being a response to the privations we experienced under lockdown. People have given up being vegan, everyone is smoking again, and if \u201cgirly pop summer\u201d (featuring Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter alongside Charli xcx) was anything to go by, partying is back. Meanwhile, the ultimate archetype of meaninglessness, the goth, made a return. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd starred in the reboot of dark superhero film The Crow, Winona Ryder reprised her role as Beetlejuice\u2019s Lydia Deetz and vampy model, musician and social media chef (see indulgence) Gabbriette was in the ascendant. The issue with foregoing all meaning and leaning into nihilism is that you can end up in some ethically dubious situations. When Nietzsche wrote his dire prediction for humanity\u2019s future, \u201cthere can be no doubt that morality will perish\u201d, he was surely thinking of the spectacle of convicted con artist Anna Sorokin and her ankle tag appearing on Dancing with the Stars. Our collective obsession with stories about scamming has morphed into an ironic open-armed embrace of the scammer. The question is, are we really having a good time? In the third season of HBO\u2019s Industry (the New Yorker\u2019s pick for TV show of the year), copious amounts of drugs, alcohol and sex fuel the endless accumulation of money and power, but none of it basked in the glow of the 80s\u2019 \u201cgreed is good\u201d film and TV. Instead, each scene plays out as if lit by the most unsparing strip lighting. Characters don\u2019t lounge opulently puffing on cigars inside high-end New York restaurants, instead huddling outside London office blocks chugging on cigarettes as if to stave off the next panic attack. If the 2010s were a battle cry against the excesses of capitalism, social injustice and climate breakdown, popular culture in 2024 seemed to have given up the fight. Of course, the cultural pendulum will no doubt swing back again. In his missive on the next \u201cvibe shift\u201d, written after Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, Monahan writes: \u201cThe vibe shift this time is a story about progressive millennials realising that when they declared total victory for their politics in 2020 \u2013 it was a pyrrhic victory \u2026 They have to get into the trenches and convince people that their interpretations of reality are correct.\u201d It sounds like a slog, but for now, grab a sweet treat or a glass of wine. There is always next year. Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the Guardian",

        "trailText": "Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish are predicted to dominate Australia\u2019s biggest music poll come Saturday\u2019s countdown, with only two local acts tipped for top-10 spots \u2013 and just one original Australian song",
        "bodyText": "When it airs on Saturday, the 32nd Triple J Hottest 100 countdown will cap off a whirlwind year for the youth radio station. There have been soaring highs: just last weekend, the station marked its mammoth five decades on air with a celebration attended by former and current presenters \u2013 as well as Anthony Albanese, who lauded the \u201cextraordinary achievement\u201d. But over the past 12 months, Triple J has continued to wrestle with its greatest existential crisis: how to engage young audiences as listenership declines steadily. The station captured just 4.3% of broadcast audiences in 2023-2024, down from 4.6% the previous year and 5.5% before that \u2013 with the majority of listeners older than Triple J\u2019s core 18-24 demographic. \u201cUnder 25s all around the world are used to consuming entertainment on demand, curated for them by algorithms which ensure they only see and hear stuff they probably already like,\u201d said one record label manager who asked not to be named. In the last year, the station has also generated controversy with several high-profile departures. This will be the first Hottest 100 without the influence of Richard Kingsmill: the kingmaker and longest-serving Triple J presenter, who left the ABC in late 2023 in a rumoured redundancy after 35 years at the station. Several other senior staff also exited at a similar time as part of a restructure of Triple J intended to \u201cevolve\u201d its offerings. It may no longer be the anti-establishment bacchanalia of its earliest days, or the alternative tastemaker of its peak in the 2000s and 2010s. But the station\u2019s countdown still draws gargantuan voting numbers \u2013 over 2.3m last year \u2013 and sends group chats ablaze with predictions and arguments. So how is this year\u2019s Hottest 100 shaping up? Viral sensations Triple J\u2019s target audience may no longer be tuning into the wireless \u2013 but they are lapping up its online content: the station has increased its following on all social channels in the past year. One song in particular went gangbusters when it was posted last January: Royel Otis\u2019s Like a Version cover of Murder on the Dancefloor, which transposed Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s original into a sunny blast of indie rock that now has 7.5m views on Triple J\u2019s YouTube and 3.9m on the station\u2019s TikTok \u2013 plus an additional 14m TikTok views when the Australian band posted it to their own account. If Royel Otis\u2019s cover wins, it will be the second Like a Version to take out the countdown after The Wiggles\u2019 2021 rendition of Elephant by Tame Impala. It\u2019s more likely, though, that this year\u2019s top spot will go to another utterly inescapable earworm: Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck, Babe!, a deeply camp poison-pen letter to a former lover complete with coruscating synths and a soaring, karaoke-hostile chorus sung entirely in falsetto. Countdown prediction site 100 Warm Tunas currently has Roan tipped to win, with Royel Otis coming in behind. The site began scraping voting data from social media posts in 2016, though its accuracy has somewhat waned over the years as \u201cpeople are now posting less and less to Instagram \u2026 and instead favour more ephemeral means of sharing, like stories,\u201d says 100 Warm Tunas creator Nick Whyte. Even so, tipsters would do well to believe his predictions: Whyte has correctly picked three of the last five winners, and this year\u2019s data is even more promising. Good Luck, Babe! (Roan\u2019s only eligible song) appears in 27% of voting slips collected by 100 Warm Tunas and Murder on the Dancefloor in 21% \u2013 whereas Whyte says previous years\u2019 top contenders have sat closer to 18%. Pop and lock it It has been exactly a decade since the Taylor Swift debacle where fans started a voting campaign for the megastar\u2019s track Shake It Off \u2013 which was later disqualified from the countdown. The hubbub now seems curiously old-fashioned in the face of genre-agnostic audiences and a Triple J playlist that includes a healthy dose of pop. \u201cThe music in the Hottest 100 is more varied nowadays,\u201d says Triple J music director Nick Findlay. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more voters celebrate a much broader musical taste in general with their votes split across different artists and genres.\u201d To no surprise, the countdown will be inundated with songs from Charli xcx\u2019s Brat and its remix album, last year\u2019s pop phenomenon which saturated the world (and certain political campaigns) in radioactive green. The British dance doyenne is slated to appear eight times in the countdown according to 100 Warm Tunas, with two tracks in the top 10. Her highest ranker is Guess, a squelching, lascivious collaboration with Hottest 100 favourite Billie Eilish \u2013 who has placed in the top 10 four times in the last five years and will probably appear at the pointy end again with her lovesick declaration Birds of a Feather. Other pop stars likely to join the fray include Taylor Swift protege Gracie Abrams with That\u2019s So True, a motor-mouthed kiss-off to an ex that became a fan favourite on TikTok; Tove Lo, with her Dom Dolla collaboration Cave; and Addison Rae, whose swooning single Diet Pepsi catapulted her from TikTok influencer to bona fide pop insider last year. But what about the Australians? Sharp-eyed pundits may notice a lack of original Australian songs in this year\u2019s predicted top 10. Joining Chappell Roan, Royel Otis, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish in the top spots are Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us; British singer-songwriter Lola Young\u2019s snarling break-up anthem Messy; Irish punk act Fontaines DC\u2019s four-minute panic attack Starburster; DJ Fred Again\u2019s fleet-footed Places To Be ; and another Charli remix \u2013 Girl, So Confusing, with Lorde. Only one local track appears alongside them: One Bad Day, a howling plea for deliverance by Perth band Spacey Jane. Data from 100 Warm Tunas, though, does have a bevy of Australian peers clocking in just behind the top 10, including Dom Dolla, Amyl and the Sniffers, The Rions, G Flip \u2013 with a cover of Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer \u2013 and Hottest 100 mainstays Ball Park Music, who have appeared 13 times in the countdown to date. Australian music has suffered on Australian charts of late. In 2024, just five out of 100 songs on Aria\u2019s year-end charts were Australian \u2013 and the highest-ranking was Vance Joy\u2019s decade-old Riptide. Last year, the number of local songs in the Hottest 100 was the lowest it had been in 10 years, at 52 tracks. Findlay says Triple J does \u201cconsistently play well over 50% of Australian music every week\u201d \u2013 above its mandated quota of 40%. And, he says, \u201c8 out of the 10 most played artists on Triple J were all local acts\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s a sign of the times: a confluence of streaming domination and cultural cringe. Or maybe we just really loved Brat. Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 will be broadcast from midday on Saturday 25 January",

        "trailText": "Charli xcx, Taylor Swift, George Clooney and Beyonc\u00e9 all voiced their approval for the Democratic candidate. But do these endorsements do more for the stars than for the politician?",
        "bodyText": "Back in July, Charli xcx posted a three-word tweet that some commentators thought might help swing the US election. Arriving the day after Kamala Harris announced her bid for the presidency, Charli\u2019s tweet said simply: \u201cKamala IS Brat.\u201d It was a reference to Charli\u2019s latest album, Brat, which had dominated the pop cultural landscape all summer and was loaded with synth-pop bangers, drug references and tales from a life spent getting messy on dancefloors. It wasn\u2019t perhaps the most obvious comparison to make with the then 59-year-old US vice-president, but the overall meaning was clear: Kamala was the presidential candidate with the most energy and authenticity \u2013 and had the approval of the pop star of the moment. The Harris campaign leaned into the endorsement, changing the backdrop of its official X page to the same garish green colour used on the record\u2019s sleeve. It helped mark Harris out as a different, more dynamic candidate than her faltering predecessor: Joe Biden may have been many things but he was most certainly not Brat. Yet as the dust settles on an extremely depressing election result, it appears clear that not only did Charli xcx\u2019s tweet have no meaningful impact on the election result, nor did the endorsement of any celebrity. Just look at the list of backers lined up for Harris. Taylor Swift, the world\u2019s biggest popstar, came out for her after the September debate, writing that Harris \u201cfights for the rights and causes I believe\u201d and signing off as a \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d \u2013 a dig at comments made by Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick JD Vance. Harrison Ford recorded a video, looking grave as he warned voters about what a danger Trump would be to democracy. And then there was Beyonc\u00e9, who even appeared at one of Harris\u2019s rallies, alongside fellow Destiny\u2019s Child member Kelly Rowland. Speaking from the stage, Beyonc\u00e9 said she was there \u201cas a mother who cares deeply about a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we\u2019re not divided\u201d. You can add to these names endorsements from the likes of LeBron James, George Clooney, Bruce Springsteen, Oprah, Lizzo, J-Lo, Eminem, Arnold Schwarzenegger and countless more. Game, set and match to Harris? Hardly. So why did their voices have so little impact? Seth Abramovitch, senior writer at the Hollywood Reporter, says that Harris\u2019s nominations were ineffective because they came largely from celebrities who were preaching to the choir: \u201cOprah, Katy Perry, Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Ariana Grande \u2013 these are artists whose audiences (black, female, liberal, queer) were already inclined to vote for Kamala.\u201d The exception to this, he says, was Swift, whose popularity in the worlds of country music and pop means she appeals to both sides of a divided US. \u201cYet I\u2019d argue her massive influence does not reach two key demographic groups that helped Trump win this time \u2013 Latinos and black men.\u201d Margaretha Bentley is a professor at Arizona State University whose classes have studied the social importance of Swift. \u201cIn the academic literature,\u201d she says, \u201cresearch has shown that, while celebrity endorsements can increase civic engagement and voter registrations, it has not proven to have a direct impact on how people make their voting decisions.\u201d Bentley likes to ask her students what influences their vote, and the overwhelming majority of responses mention family (especially parents), friends and personal values. \u201cVoters may do more research after a celebrity endorses, but they will vote based on their own values and not necessarily the values of the celebrity endorser.\u201d Recent data seem to back that up. The vote.gov website received 405,999 visitors in the 24 hours after Swift shared its URL with her followers. \u201cThere is robust evidence that celebrities do have a real impact in promoting overall, nonpartisan civic engagement \u2013 from encouraging voter registration to poll worker signups,\u201d says Ashley Spillane who authored Celebrities Strengthening Our Culture of Democracy, a Harvard study published in August. But the same report also found that it was hard to quantify whether an increased drive of voters to the polls corresponded with positive outcomes for the endorsed candidate. So if people are not going to vote in the way the endorsed campaign wants, is there any actual value in seeking out an endorsement? \u201cThat\u2019s a great question and one that the research has not fully been able to answer,\u201d says Bentley. \u201cFrom my standpoint, as an educator, if celebrity endorsements encourage civic engagement, then that is a good thing.\u201d Of course, courting celebrities is nothing new. Ahead of the 1920 election, Al Jolson led a march of fellow actors through the streets of Ohio in support of Republican Warren G Harding\u2019s bid, and even penned what became the official campaign song. Endorsements from Babe Ruth, Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand have all been coveted by the candidates of their day \u2013 and possibly with good reason. A 2008 study by Northwestern University, for instance, claimed that Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement of Barack Obama added around a million votes to his final tally. But that was in a very different political landscape. A poll from YouGov shortly after Swift\u2019s endorsement found that only 8% of voters would be \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cmuch more\u201d likely to vote for Harris \u2013 with a surprising 20% saying the endorsement actually made them less likely to vote for her. Has there been a recent shift in the way we view celebrity endorsements? Laurence F Maslon, an arts professor at New York University, doesn\u2019t believe so. \u201cI think endorsements have probably always done more for the celebrity than the person being endorsed. I think sometimes it\u2019s a way to hitch your star to somebody who seems to be good for you, and maybe there\u2019s a certain kind of reflected glory in that,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you look at, say, Sinatra\u2019s endorsement of John F Kennedy, that was probably more of a big deal for Sinatra, because it allowed him to get a seat at the table and he probably thought it would help him achieve that next level of stardom.\u201d Still, Maslon accepts that there has been a concerted effort by the Republican party over the past few decades to counter the fact that Democrats receive the biggest celebrity endorsements. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a Republican candidate for any office in the last 20 years who didn\u2019t append the word liberal before the word Hollywood when speaking about it,\u201d he says. Ultimately, it means a celebrity endorsement becomes baked into the overall discourse. \u201cPeople like George Clooney and Robert De Niro, I mean, who cares, frankly?\u201d Certainly, Republicans have made a great deal out of the idea of \u201celites\u201d in recent years, feeding into the idea that what works for a celebrity is not necessarily what\u2019s in the best interests of the average person on the street. Beyonc\u00e9, the argument goes, is hardly likely to be worrying about the price of gas. The view that celebrities are so divorced from real life that they\u2019re not worth listening to is encapsulated by a brief Ricky Gervais video posted in June, which resurfaced as a viral meme just before the election: \u201cAs a celebrity, I know all about stuff like science and politics so trust me when I tell you who you should vote for,\u201d Gervais says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote the right way, it\u2019s like a hate crime and that makes me sad and angry and I\u2019ll leave the country and you don\u2019t want that.\u201d You may find that view of democracy \u2013 that we all know so little we should refrain from using our voices \u2013 unbelievably cynical. But it taps into a backlash against endorsements that, in recent years, has taken a darker turn with the rise of QAnon and other conspiracy theories regarding the alleged perversions of Hollywood stars. During this year\u2019s cycle, endorsements were often countered online by Trump supporters arguing that the celebrity in question would have been present at parties hosted by Diddy, the rapper and record executive who is now in jail charged with sex trafficking and racketeering. By linking the two, and implying that liberal celebrities were in some way at least conscious of Diddy\u2019s alleged crimes, they serve to undermine the whole power of celebrity itself, rebranding it from something glitzy and desirable to the face of evil. But then conspiracy theories during elections are nothing new. \u201cThere will always be a segment of voters who mistrust celebrity and Hollywood and lean into conspiracy theories,\u201d says Abramovitch. Despite all this, nobody would be surprised to see politicians clambering for endorsements when the next election comes around. After all, there\u2019s nothing to say they actively harmed Harris\u2019s campaign \u2013 she may have done much worse without them. Even Maslon admits that \u201cto have the most famous black female singer in the world not endorse Harris probably would have been a big negative, just by implication\u201d. Ultimately, Maslon says, there is really only one celebrity endorsement that has been shown to make a huge difference in US elections \u2013 and that\u2019s when the candidate is already a celebrity. \u201cAnd so they endorse themselves!\u201d He cites George Murphy, the 1940s movie star who ran successfully to become the senator for California, paving the way for the likes of Ronald Reagan, Schwarzenegger and of course Trump. \u201cIt seems to happen a lot in the Republican party,\u201d he says. So if Swift or Beyonc\u00e9 really want their celebrity star power to have an effect on the polls, perhaps they\u2019ll have to ditch the endorsements and run for office themselves. Just not for the party they currently support.",

        "bodyText": "Stars such as Lady Gaga, Charli xcx, Ed Sheeran and Missy Elliott will face blazing temperatures this weekend at an unusually hot Coachella festival. The California-based festival will soar to potentially record-breaking highs of 103F (over 39C) in its first of two consecutive weekends, about 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit higher than what\u2019s typically expected at this time of year. The festival, which usually attracts around 125,000 people a day, is following a year that saw its slowest sales to date, headlined by Doja Cat, Lana del Rey and Tyler, the Creator. The 2025 edition is being viewed by some as an unofficial comeback with headliners Lady Gaga, Green Day and Post Malone, who together boast 24% higher global Spotify streams than the previous trio. Gaga previously headlined Coachella in 2017, when she also filmed scenes for A Star Is Born. In a recent interview, she said she would focus on her new album, Mayhem, but also give fans the older hits they want. She said she saw it as \u201can opportunity to do something unique and special\u201d but remained tightlipped about specifics. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t want to give anything away about Coachella,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that is heartless of me, in a way, but I could honestly cry on the phone with you just thinking about how excited I am to do this show, and I want it to be a total surprise, and want everyone to have as much fun as possible.\u201d The lineup boasts a wide variety of acts from different genres and eras. The newer guard is represented by Lola Young, Shaboozey, Amyl and the Sniffers, Rema, underscores and Glorilla, while nostalgia plays are led by Jimmy Eat World, Missy Elliott, Kraftwerk, Basement Jaxx and the Go-Gos. The weekend will also see the Prodigy play, returning to Coachella for the first time since Keith Flint died in 2019. \u201cI will say that us carrying on isn\u2019t a Keith tribute show,\u201d band member Liam Howlett recently told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe want to honor him, and we will continue to do that, because Keith is more than just a person they saw on stage. Even though he wasn\u2019t a musician, he was such an important person in the studio as a right-hand man.\u201d Another throwback act playing is Weezer, a band who have been making headlines this week after bassist Scott Shriner\u2019s wife, Jillian Lauren, was shot by police. Reports claim that she aimed a handgun at officers as they investigated an unrelated hit-and-run incident and she is now being charged with attempted murder. The band is still set to perform as scheduled with Scott saying \u201csee you at Coachella\u201d to journalists on Thursday. One act who won\u2019t be performing is FKA twigs, who was forced to pull out \u201cdue to ongoing visa issues\u201d related to her production team reportedly failing to fill out the correct paperwork in time. The star wrote that she was \u201cdevastated\u201d in an Instagram statement. Rising costs and more complicated logistics have also caused trouble for other artists seeking visas to perform. \u201cI just did visas for a Coachella band and it was $8,000,\u201d a booking agency executive told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a huge financial hurdle because it takes so long through regular channels, you have to go for the heavy-duty expediting.\u201d",

        "trailText": "This liveblog is now closed.",
        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar ruled the Grammys during a night that also paid tribute to those affected by the California wildfires. The night\u2019s biggest prize, for album of the year, went to Beyonc\u00e9 for Cowboy Carter, the first time she has won the award. It was presented by members of the Los Angeles country fire department in one of many of the night\u2019s tributes to those affected by the wildfires. The ceremony took place at the Crypto.com arena in LA. The singer is only the fourth Black woman to win the award. \u201cIt\u2019s been many many years,\u201d she said to loud applause. A visibly shocked Beyonc\u00e9 also won for best country album, saying she \u201creally was not expecting this\u201d as she accepted the award. \u201cSometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists and I just want to encourage people to do what they\u2019re passionate about,\u201d she said. She was given the award by Taylor Swift. \u201cI will never forget standing here almost exactly 15 years ago,\u201d she said while looking back on her win in this category. Beyonc\u00e9, who also won for best country duo performance with Miley Cyrus, became the first Black woman to win a country Grammy for 50 years. Chris Stapleton took home the award for best country solo performance. Lamar won five awards for his controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us, which is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit. He took home both song and record of the year. During one of his speeches, Lamar, who is performing at next week\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, said he wanted to \u201cdedicate this one to the city\u201d. After last year saw Taylor Swift, SZA, Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish dominate, this year saw another strong female showing with Beyonc\u00e9, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Doechii and Chappell Roan winning many of the major awards. In the competitive best new artist category, Chappell Roan beat out Shaboozey, Raye, Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter. She used her speech to call on the industry to \u201coffer a livable wage and healthcare especially to emerging artists\u201d before telling the story of how she struggled to survive in her early days as a musician. \u201cLabels, we got you but do you got us?\u201d she asked. Charli xcx picked up three awards in the pop categories but lost out on pop solo performance and pop vocal album to Sabrina Carpenter. Doechii won for best rap album, becoming only the third woman to do so. Other female winners included SZA who picked up best R&amp;B song for Saturn, St Vincent who took home best alternative music album, best rock song and best alternative music performance, Kacey Musgraves who picked up best country song for The Architect and Shakira who won best Latin pop album. The Colombian singer dedicated her award to \u201call my immigrant brothers and sisters\u201d. Jimmy Carter was also a posthumous winner for the audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Chris Brown were controversial picks for comedy album and R&amp;B album respectively. Host Trevor Noah began the night by referring to the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances that have changed the tone and motivation of this year\u2019s awards. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest national disasters in American history,\u201d he said while speaking about the devastating California wildfires and calling attention to the spirit of those who have endured. To kick off the show, he introduced Dawes, a band who have lost homes and instruments as a result of the fires. They have also helped raise money for nearly 100 other families. They were joined by artists including John Legend, Sheryl Crow and St Vincent for a special performance paying tribute to Los Angeles. Noah drew attention to a number of charities and organisations, telling those in the room and viewers at home that there would be a QR code which would allow people to contribute. He later said that Amazon Music, CBS and Mastercard had donated. He also said the night would highlight local businesses affected by the fires with the venue both catered and decorated by some and with a certain amount of advertising space given to others. While presenting the award for song of the year, Diana Ross said: \u201cMay this moment remind us all of the power we hold to rebuild, to lift and to come together with compassion.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars performed a duet of California Dreamin\u2019 after a montage highlighting Californians who had lost their homes in the fires. The pair later won the best pop duo performance award for their song Die with a Smile. In her acceptance speech, she said: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d Noah had a number of jabs at the returning US president, joking that millions of immigrants were also part of this year\u2019s voting body. When speaking about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s just-announced tour, he joked: \u201cThere\u2019s tariffs, we can\u2019t afford a new tour! Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Alicia Keys was given the Dr Dre global impact award and spoke to the importance of diversity in music. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry,\u201d she said. She also added that \u201cthis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices\u201d and that \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift\u201d. Other performances throughout the night included Billie Eilish who ended her performance saying \u201cI love LA\u201d, Sabrina Carpenter who sang a rejigged and physically comedic take on her hits Espresso and Please Please Please, Chappell Roan who was introduced by Olivia Rodrigo (the Vampire singer called her \u201cmy extraordinary friend\u201d) and a surprise appearance from the Weeknd who had previously pledged a permanent boycott of the Grammys. His performance was introduced by the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who spoke about the many structural changes he had helped implement which then lured the Weeknd back. There was also a star-studded tribute to Quincy Jones who died last year. Will Smith, making his first appearance on a major televised awards ceremony since the infamous slap, called Jones \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our time\u201d in an introduction to a performance that featured Janelle Monae, Herbie Hancock, Cynthia Erivo and Stevie Wonder, who led a rendition of We Are the World with a choir wearing special LA sweaters. Smith explained that the singers represented two schools that had been lost in the fires. Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin also sang an accompaniment to this year\u2019s in memoriam section which included late stars including Liam Payne, Kris Kristofferson, Cissy Houston, Marianne Faithfull, Bob Newhart, Wayne Osmond and S\u00e9rgio Mendes. Last year saw Taylor Swift become the first artist to win album of the year four times but tonight she went home empty-handed despite six nominations. Other nominees who left without any awards included Shaboozey, Post Malone, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish.",

        "bodyText": "POLITICS Benjamin Netanyahu Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister ends the year under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, and taking the stand in a long-delayed corruption trial at home. Yet Benjamin Netanyahu is also in a stronger political position than most of his critics expected The 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas happened on his watch, but he has defied calls for a state commission of inquiry to investigate security failures that left the country so vulnerable. Unlike military commanders and intelligence officers in charge on that day, he has not apologised. Netanyahu started 2024 facing domestic demonstrations demanding a ceasefire and hostage deal. Israel was at war in Gaza, under attack from Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatened by Iran and its allies from Yemen to Iraq. He insisted that only \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas would make the country secure. He shrugged off accusations that he was more concerned about his political future than the lives of Israeli hostages, as head of a coalition government with right-wing partners who threatened to leave if he agreed a ceasefire. He ends the year claiming triumph over Iran and its self-proclaimed axis of resistance across the region. Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and arsenal are in ruins, Assad has fled Syria, Hamas leaders have been killed by Israel. Still, the image of Israel\u2019s prime minister being grilled in court about corruption while leading a multi-front conflict with troops on the ground in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria is a jarring one. Nearly half the country thinks Netanyahu cannot effectively function as a wartime leader while giving testimony, recent polling found. He has responded, as he habitually does, by going on the attack with a media campaign effectively painting himself as a martyr to unpatriotic enemies. His ruthless political instincts have focused, critics say, on his own survival. This year they appear to have served him well in the short term, though the long-term cost to Netanyahu and his country is still unclear. Emma Graham-Harrison Rachel Reeves If there is one UK politician who has shot from relative obscurity to household name in 2024, it is Rachel Reeves. Ever since she became an MP in 2010, Reeves had yearned to be the first woman chancellor of the exchequer. She would joke to friends about mentioning her work as a Bank of England economist at least once in every speech to make sure people knew she had the pedigree. It is a post that has existed some 800 years without a woman having been put in charge of the nation\u2019s finances. On 5 June 2024, the 45-year-old entered the Treasury to rapturous applause, having made history. It was a great day for women in politics, she told her civil servants. She was not always Keir Starmer\u2019s first choice to run economic policy \u2013 he gave the shadow chancellorship to Anneliese Dodds. But less than a year later Reeves replaced her and began plotting her path from opposition into Threadneedle Street. Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget in September 2022 was Reeves\u2019s key moment. Reeves saw that she and Labour had the keys to Downing Street if they could convince voters they would be the exact opposite to the Tories. Labour would pledge to keep a tight grip on spending and not put up taxes on working people. She would also promise the highest growth in the G7 by investing in a green revolution. Now, after the general election, Reeves is confronting the realities of high office. Being chancellor with an economy dragging along the bottom is no breeze. Everyone has demands on you and blames you for what goes wrong. In her first budget, Reeves decided to plug a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances by raising employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. She also cut back winter fuel payments to only the poorest pensioners and retained the two-child cap on benefits. She had become Labour\u2019s new \u2018ironchancellor\u2019. By late this year there were signs of economic growth slowing, not growing, and that job vacancies were declining. 2024 gave us our first woman chancellor. But Reeves knows the next two or three years will present a still bigger test. Toby Helm Kemi Badenoch Anyone who navigates Westminster\u2019s pitfalls to seize the leadership of their party has had a year to remember. But in Kemi Badenoch\u2019s case, she was one of very few Conservative politicians to have taken anything positive from a year that has proved to be the most bruising in the party\u2019s long history. After a disastrous early election campaign that saw Rishi Sunak\u2019s premiership end in crushing defeat, Badneoch was immediately a frontrunner in the race to lead a rebuild in opposition. Having forged an image as an anti-woke, no-nonsense culture warrior since entering parliament in 2017, she had built up a fan base in the party after an ultimately unsuccessful leadership bid to replace Boris Johnson in 2022. After Sunak\u2019s demise, Badenoch found herself playing a different role. Rather than being the insurgent candidate, she was seen as the figure capable of appealing to the right while also being tolerated by the party\u2019s mainstream. There is no question that appointing her as leader is a gamble at a critical moment for the Tories. Her often deliberately abrasive style will ensure she gains attention \u2013 often the hardest trick to pull off for opposition leaders. But her attacks on actor David Tennant or her claim that some civil servants should be in prison cause more problems than they solve. Poor approval ratings for both her and her party mean Badenoch needs a productive 2025 to begin the recovery. Michael Savage Emmanuel Macron It was a year of highs and lows for the French president. Doomsayers and drenching rain at the opening ceremony failed to dampen the success of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, hailed as a triumph by even cynical Parisians. The reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in five years, as Macron promised on the night of the devastating fire in April 2019, was a triumph of presidential will, collective spirit and an army of French artisans. The lows, however, were of Macron\u2019s making. After he called an ill-advised snap election, his centrist government lost its majority and had to resign and there is ongoing political paralysis. Kim Willsher Nigel Farage It\u2019s a face more often seen at Mar-a-Lago than Clacton-on-Sea, but Nigel Farage had something else to gurn about in 2024 when he was elected to represent Britain\u2019s most Brexity seaside town in parliament, his eighth attempt to become an MP. During that election campaign I spent a dispiriting day in Jaywick, the wild-west end of that constituency, asking residents exactly what they saw in the pin-striped populist, to be repeatedly told versions of that lie: he\u2019s the only one on our side. A dozen years ago I had followed Farage on his neverending tour of town hall meetings, whipping up Ukip anger about wind farms and Brussels bureaucracy. At the time, not long after the election of David Cameron\u2019s coalition government, the politician seemed messianic about the prospects of his one-man party. He sensed and nurtured the hardening of British attitudes on the centre right in those gatherings; the feeling, shaped by austerity, in home counties village halls and left-behind towns, that \u201cWestminster\u201d had nothing to say to them. He predicted to me then: \u201cI would think in the next four to five years we will \u2026 succeed in realigning a segment of the British political scene.\u201d He has, fatefully, succeeded. The referendum, his pound-shop \u201cindependence day\u201d, tore the country in half and in the fallout, as he predicted, the great electoral force of the Tory party has crashed and burned, with Farage emerging from the wreckage. Successive Conservative prime ministers post-2016 attempted to cosplay versions of his populism. Only a few months into the Labour landslide government, voices are already muttering, in the way that they have now muttered for a dozen years, that their primary task is finding ways to counter Farage\u2019s stubborn hold on a large part of the nation\u2019s political imagination. That task will not be made easier by Farage\u2019s pending alliance with the Trump government and Elon Musk. Loathe him or loathe him, his is the face that refuses to go away. Tim Adams HEROES Gis\u00e8le Pelicot Pelicot, 73, became an international icon and feminism gained a new slogan after she bravely waived her anonymity in a grim trial that saw her ex-husband, Dominique, found guilty of drugging her and inviting more than 50 strangers into the marital home to rape her over a 10-year period. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot insisted the press and public be allowed in the courtroom to witness the videos he made of the appalling abuse so \u201cshame changes sides\u201d. Watching the men scuttle in and out of the courthouse hiding their faces as she strode in, head held high, meant it did. Kim Willsher Alan Bates It was tempting in January, when Mr Bates vs the Post Office aired on ITV, to think that, finally, justice would be done. But as the year draws to an end, the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance is contemplating a fresh round of legal action after being told that many post office operators might still not receive compensation by the summer of 2025. The TV drama had a huge impact, and probably played a part in the promotion of Alan Bates from mister to sir when he was knighted in June for forging the campaign from hundreds of subpostmasters who were wrongfully accused of theft, fraud and false accounting, because faults in the Post Office\u2019s Horizon IT system made it seem as though money was missing from branch accounts. Most viewers will still have a mental picture of Sir Alan as Toby Jones, the actor who portrayed him, but his face will haunt executives at the Post Office and Fujitsu, which made the Horizon IT system, and the government ministers whose actions have been examined at the inquiry. The inquiry heard the closing arguments in the week before Christmas, after hearing from more than 5,000 witnesses as it unpicked the miscarriages of justice that saw more than 900 people wrongfully convicted between 1999 and 2015. But nearly three years of inquiry hearings were less effective than four hours of TV in demonstrating the horror experienced by the workers as computers invented inexplicable figures, which investigators and courts then asked them to explain. Politicians promised action, but although \u00a3363m has been paid to about 2,900 claimants, the government says it probably won\u2019t complete compensation before Bates\u2019s deadline of March 2025. Meanwhile the inquiry report may appear next year, or possibly in 2026. By then there may have been some prosecutions \u2013 police say they have found dozens of persons of interest. But do not bank on an ITV sequel. The channel said it actually lost money from the show, because few international broadcasters decided to buy it. The Post Office is not the right kind of fading British institution to appeal to foreign audiences. James Tapper Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah In a year of alarming outcomes for the environment that saw average global air temperatures peak again, 2024 has also played out as a landmark moment for veteran clean air campaigner Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah, who secured a historic apology from the UK government in October for the death of her daughter, Ella, from air pollution in 2013. Kissi-Debrah had lived with her three children, including Ella, just 25 metres from London\u2019s South Circular Road in Lewisham when Ella, then aged nine, suffered a fatal asthma attack as a result of excessive exposure to traffic emissions. After seven years of litigation, Kissi-Debrah secured a coroner\u2019s verdict to have the cause of death on Ella\u2019s death certificate changed from asthma to air pollution. The inquest found that levels of nitrogen dioxide near Ella\u2019s home had exceeded both World Health Organization and European Union guidelines, and the verdict made Ella the first person in the world to be legally recognised as having been killed by toxic air. Kissi-Debrah has since gone on to campaign for a new clean air bill, widely dubbed as \u201cElla\u2019s law\u201d, stating that \u201cthe number of children who still die from asthma has not changed since Ella\u2019s death.\u201d Air pollution is estimated to kill up to 36,000 people in the UK and 7 million globally each year. October\u2019s apology from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which came as part of an out of court settlement of claims made by Ella\u2019s estate, commended the impact of Kissi-Debrah\u2019s \u201ctireless work\u201d to raise awareness around public health, saying that \u201cyoung children like Ella should not have to suffer because of our air\u201d. \u201cI believe every child has a right to breathe clean air,\u201d Kissi-Debrah stated, \u201cno matter where they live, their ethnic background or their economic status.\u201d Ashish Ghadiali SOCIAL MEDIA Elon Musk This is Elon Musk\u2019s year. But it may also be his century. A year ago, he was the world\u2019s richest man who owned, among other things, a global communications platform and a fleet of rockets. He\u2019s now $200bn richer and attached to the hip of the man with the keys to the world\u2019s greatest superpower. Musk is not thinking in four-year election cycles. His eyes are on the future. And he\u2019s now in an unprecedented position to control it, appointed to oversee Trump\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d and poised to mop up from government contracts and the dismantling of any federal legislation that might stand in his way. It was after the failed attempt on Trump\u2019s life in July that Musk went all in on him. In classic Silicon Valley style, he went for a high-risk but high-reward strategy, donating $277m directly to Trump\u2019s campaign, though this is a drop in the ocean compared to the impact that his platform made. Musk rebuilt Twitter as X, a force multiplier of Maga talking heads and talking points and he\u2019s made it clear that he intends to roll this out globally. This is power of a kind the world has never seen before. It\u2019s state + corporate + media power. Musk didn\u2019t buy Twitter to make money in the short term. That was why it was so baffling to many media pundits. But as a long-term plan it made perfect sense: a means of exerting influence to make money \u2013 and accrue more power \u2013 in the long run. And as 2024 has proved, it worked. Carole Cadwalladr Moo Deng Perhaps it\u2019s a sign of rising food prices that whenever a baby animal went viral in 2024, people named it after a type of food. Moo Deng (\u201cbouncy pork\u201d), the baby pygmy hippo from Thailand, fended off rival Edinburgher hippo, Haggis (\u201csheep\u2019s offal boiled in a bag\u201d), as well as Cinnamon the fugitive capybara, Pesto the penguin and Peanut the squirrel to become 2024\u2019s undisputed champion of cute, assuming that glistening, toothless zoo animals meet your definition of cuteness. Certainly Moo Deng has all the necessary elements of kindchenschema, the scientific name for the \u201cset of baby-like features\u201d that define cuteness. The made-for-TikTok big eyes, small nose, chubby cheeks and plump and no doubt succulent legs make her good enough to eat, and possibly cheaper than either a cup of climate-ravaged coffee or a Moo Deng-themed cake. James Tapper SPORT Simone Biles At the start of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Simone Biles was one of the most dominant forces in sports, unbeaten in all-around competition since her rookie year in 2013. Just a couple of days in, however, things had unravelled spectacularly. Biles was suffering from the twisties, a mental block that meant she could no longer track her position in the air during skills. She spent the vast majority of her miserable time in Tokyo watching on from the stands. As Biles departed Tokyo, her future was completely uncertain. Three years is an eternity in gymnastics, and her mental injury had been triggered by trauma and overwhelming pressure. But after therapy and a brilliant comeback in 2023, Biles returned for her third Olympic games. What Biles achieved in Paris this year was nothing short of astounding. She finished with three gold medals and a silver, including victories in the most important all-around and team finals. Biles nailed her Yurchenko Double Pike vault, arguably the most difficult skill ever successfully attempted by a female gymnast, in Olympic competition for the first time ever. At 27 years old, Biles helps refute the myth that female gymnasts peak in their teens and cannot succeed at the highest level deep into their 20s. As she racked up medals in Paris, Biles\u2019s presence at the Bercy Arena attracted full crowds, a thunderous atmosphere and countless celebrities as the world tried to catch a glimpse of a peerless athlete at the height of her powers. They were privileged to witness one of the greatest sporting comebacks in history. Tumaini Carayol Raygun There were, to be fair, some decent efforts at this summer\u2019s Olympic Games: not least from Simone Biles, home hero L\u00e9on Marchand and Mondo Duplantis, the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet of the pole vault. But the standout star of Paris 2024? That was obviously Dr Rachael Gunn, a 36-year-old Australian breakdancer (and professor!) also known as B-Girl Raygun. Ironically, that title was the only thing she actually did win at the Olympics. In the competition, Raygun\u2019s performances \u2013 which included befuddling moves such as the sprinkler and the kangaroo hop \u2013 led to three emphatic 18-0 defeats. At the time, singer Adele stopped her concert in Munich to speak for all of us: \u201cMe and my friends have been shitting ourselves laughing for 24 hours.\u201d Tim Lewis Gareth Southgate His role as England men\u2019s football manager in 2016 was meant to be a stopgap \u2013 an interim until a better candidate could be found. But Gareth Southgate left the most demanding and least rewarding job in English football this summer as arguably the most consistently successful manager the country has ever had. A tournament record of two finals, one semi and a quarter-final in eight years would be decent for Germany or Spain; for England, it is unprecedented. A clearly decent chap, Southgate changed the culture of the dressing room and the experience of watching the team. Players appeared to enjoy turning out for him, and this in turn alleviated much of the dread that came with being an England fan. He even reversed the greatest stigma of all: going to penalties. England sustained five successive shootout fails before Southgate took charge. Under his quiet, supportive and well-prepared leadership, they won three and lost one. And yet counterintuitively, after a briefish honeymoon period \u2013 the waistcoat-inspired run in the 2018 World Cup in Russia \u2013 Southgate started being hunted down by the haters. Even when England won, as they kept on doing, they weren\u2019t happy. When Southgate and his players took the knee before matches in 2021 and 2022, to protest against racism, he became Woke-gate. He appeared to be ground down by the criticism and an expectation \u2013 that he created \u2013 where victory was assumed and defeat was unacceptable. Ultimately Southgate never escaped his identity as a place-holder. Perhaps his greatest legacy will be how difficult more acclaimed managers find it to follow in his footsteps. Tim Lewis ARTS &amp; MEDIA Saoirse Ronan It was an unscripted moment in October that sent Irish actor Saoirse Ronan, 30, viral, after appearing on BBC Friday-night staple the Graham Norton Show. She was sat alongside fellow actors Eddie Redmayne, Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington as Redmayne explained how he was shown to use a phone in self-defence for his role in the new TV version of The Day of the Jackal. Mescal was joshing about the idea of using a phone as a weapon. Suddenly Ronan seemed to rise like an ice queen from the sofa as she said: \u201cThat\u2019s what girls have to think about all the time.\u201d A pause; a little glint at the studio audience. \u201cAm I right, ladies?\u201d A fleeting moment, over in seconds, but the world went wild. Well, the female half of it anyway. Clearly, Ronan had missed the memo about being careful and dull in celebrity interviews. Why did it matter so much? Maybe because, as much as Ronan was being real, being herself, she was also everywoman. Every woman who\u2019s ever held their keys a certain way on a dark street and who wouldn\u2019t find it particularly outlandish to use a phone or anything else as a weapon if they had to. In its way, it was a feminist triumph (chatshow division). With her impromptu truth bomb, Ronan reminded everyone that female safety, or the lack of it, is on every woman\u2019s mind all the time. Let\u2019s not forget her remarkable performances as an alcoholic in The Outrun (a film she also co-produced) and a panic-stricken mother searching for her child in Steve McQueen\u2019s second world war film Blitz. In July, it was reported in the Irish Independent that she\u2019d married long-term partner, actor Jack Lowden. Barbara Ellen Taylor Swift The bestselling album of 2024. The most-streamed artist. The most successful tour of all time. Friendship bracelets. Occupying the top 14 places in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart simultaneously. Winning an unprecedented fourth album of the year Grammy. Swiftonomics \u2013 the financial uplift in areas the Eras Tour passed through. A double LP \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department \u2013 that eloquently mourned lost love while laundering some spectacularly grubby smalls in public. The childless cat-lady-in-chief totally bossed music in 2024. Kitty Empire Charli xcx Kamala Harris might not have been elected the first female US president in 2024, but when her socials went lurid green this summer, it marked the point where peak \u201cbrat\u201d was achieved. British singer Charlotte Aitchison, known as Charli xcx, gave this year\u2019s summer its hedonistic vibe with her album Brat and a signature colour with its green album artwork. Though the exact definition of \u201cbrat\u201d was never clear, what was obvious was that xcx, for so long a cult tastemaker, having racked up a UK No 1 and seven Grammy nominations, had finally got her flowers. Kitty Empire Jilly Cooper What a stellar year for \u201cqueen of the bonkbuster\u201d novelist Jilly Cooper. Adapted for Disney Plus, her 1988 tome Rivals was instantly hailed as a small-screen phenomenon despite (or because of) being an entirely inappropriate saga of handsome scoundrels, too-tight riding breeches, lusty housewives, jiggling posteriors, stately piles, posh totty and naked tennis. The British public fell upon it like ravenous beasts, delighting in the 87-year-old author\u2019s singular brand of deft, light-hearted satire and mischief. A second season has already been commissioned. Is La Cooper back in fashion? Did she ever go out? Barbara Ellen Huw Edwards As the newsreader who covered Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral, the king\u2019s coronation and the inauguration of Barack Obama, Huw Edwards\u2019 features are so well-known that every facial twitch is familiar, the lilt of his phrasing possible to predict. He had been absent from television screens since the summer of 2023, after reports that he had paid a young person for sexually explicit images, but in July 2024 he was charged with making indecent images of children and in September the 63-year-old received a six-month suspended prison sentence. As the BBC announced it was removing many of his performances from its archive, his court appearances could become his last public images. Vanessa Thorpe Princess of Wales Despite her position as one of the nation\u2019s favourite royals, Kate has never experienced so much intense scrutiny as this year. It was announced in January that Kate was undergoing abdominal surgery and would not return to public duty until Easter. During her three-month absence, amateur detectives attempted to solve the crime that many swore was unfolding. Accusations of body doubles and doctored photographs were exacerbated by evidence that some family photos had indeed been digitally enhanced. When she revealed her cancer diagnosis in a filmed personal statement, some conspiracy theorists were still not convinced, but as Kate has started to make more public appearances, the wilder ideas have started to subside. Better news of successful treatment was to come in September, but each wave and smile is still analysed with uncomfortable probity. Vanessa Thorpe",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight.

        "headline": "From Drake\u2019s humiliation to Doechii\u2019s coronation: the talking points from the 2025 Grammys",
        "trailText": "Kendrick Lamar celebrated his rap beef victory in a \u2018Canadian tuxedo\u2019, Chappell Roan called out the industry and Nashville finally backed Beyonc\u00e9",
        "bodyText": "Drake was humiliated It\u2019s the kind of stress dream that pop stars tell their therapists about: \u201cMy artistic rival won record and song of the year at the Grammys for a track attacking me, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Even Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d And so it came to pass for Drake, seeing Kendrick Lamar win for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim \u2013 a \u201cCanadian tuxedo\u201d, no less \u2013 while half the arena seemed to chant \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably a minor\u201d, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn\u2019t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards \u2013 and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar \u2013 the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake? Chappell Roan called for workers\u2019 rights \u2026 For all her playfulness on stage and on record, there\u2019s also a seriousness of intent to Chappell Roan: part of the reason she\u2019s so loved is that she totally devotes herself to her craft, selling every line she sings. That\u2019s played out in her earnest politics, too, whether upbraiding a hectoring paparazzo, fretting about who to back (if anyone) in the US presidential race, and championing the rights of queer people and Palestinians. At the Grammys, she used the platform of a best new artist win to advocate for workers\u2019 rights, namely her fellow musicians, with a \u201cdemand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\u201d She spoke of struggling to afford health insurance in her early career, saying: \u201cIt was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised to not have health[care]. If my label would have prioritised artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to \u2026 Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d \u2026 and Lady Gaga for trans rights As Donald Trump enshrines transphobia in American law, Lady Gaga spoke out, saying: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d She was speaking after winning best pop duo/group performance for Die With a Smile, with Bruno Mars. Doechii capped her breakthrough year \u2026 Twenty-six-year-old rapper Doechii beat some of the most venerable, successful and respected MCs in the US \u2013 Eminem, Future, J Cole and the paired-up Common and Pete Rock \u2013 to win best rap album, only the third woman to win this category after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. This caps a stunning breakthrough over the past year, with jaws floored by the emphatically enunciated, elastically rhythmic raps on her album Alligator Bites Don\u2019t Heal, and then again by performances such as on Stephen Colbert\u2019s talkshow, her braided hair fused to that of her dancers. Her performance on the Grammys\u2019 stage was even stronger, a brilliantly choreographed strut through Denial Is a River where \u2013 with some expert help from her DJ, Miss Milan \u2013 she kept her flow going through high kicks, trust falls and a suit-busting bikini reveal. \u2026 as did Sierra Ferrell With her fourth album, Ferrell made a clean sweep of the roots and Americana categories, winning all four of the awards she was nominated for (in a less brutally competitive year, she would have got a best new artist nomination too). Dressed in one of the night\u2019s wackier outfits \u2013 think East End pearly queen after five rounds of AI enhancement, complete with sceptre \u2013 she\u2019s travelled a long way from the trailer-dwelling and freight train-hopping of her youth, to become a multimillion-streaming performer. As country and pop do-si-do ever more tightly, Ferrell, Zach Bryan and more are winning millions of fans drawn to a more authentic and analogue-sounding version of this vintage American music. Beyonc\u00e9 finally won album of the year She may have been the most-awarded star in history, but given the industry places such stock in the album format, Beyonc\u00e9 not winning that category felt like a big snub \u2013 particularly given her self-titled album lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase (not remotely the best album that year or in his own catalogue), while her great masterpiece 4 wasn\u2019t even nominated. So that wrong has now been righted. Some may be dismayed that it took a country album to do it, rather than an R&amp;B, pop or dance record \u2013 and Cowboy Carter has plenty of longueurs and even outright missteps. But it also contains some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most imaginative and beautiful music \u2013 the way Riverdance flows into II Hands II Heaven makes it the loveliest brace of songs on an album in her catalogue. Its bigger win in some ways is best country album, showing that Beyonc\u00e9 has convinced not just the broad pool of voters in the general field categories, but also the Nashville establishment who vote for the country awards. An American won best global music album Matt B, a little-streamed musician born and raised in Illinois and based in the US, beat representatives from Spain (Antonio Rey), Peru (Ciro Hurtado), and Nigeria (superstars Tems and Rema) to win best global music album for Alkebulan II, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. His album certainly creates a global dialogue, as he explores his African heritage with multilingual lyrics, lilting Afro-pop, and guests such as South African poet Nomfundo Khambule. But as the US enters its protectionist era under Trump, there may be some disquiet at this win. A multimillionare businesswoman won best new age album It\u2019s a shame that the great Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician who died of cancer aged 71 in 2023 having changed the face of his country\u2019s popular music, wasn\u2019t honoured in the category for best new age, ambient or chant album. His nominated LP Opus was full of his very particular piano style, full of chords that feel cautious and yet intentional, and where sentimentality is offset by chalky, dissonant notes. Instead, he lost to the little-heard Triveni by Wouter Kellerman, Eru Matsumoto and Chandrika Tandon, the latter a businesswoman and philanthropist (and sister of former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi) who worked for McKinsey before starting her own financial services firm. The Academy still loves Chris Stapleton He lost to Beyonc\u00e9 in the country album category, but Stapleton notched up his fifth win in 10 years in the best country solo performance category, a mark of how much the country-voting portion of the Recording Academy adores this artist, who pleases both staunch traditionalists while being relatively progressive \u2013 that\u2019s 11 wins overall for him now. It\u2019s a shame, though, that he won with a low-stakes ballad from the same album as his win last year, while shutting out Shaboozey\u2019s pop culturally dominant A Bar Song (Tipsy) in the process. Chris Brown was awarded Way after his notorious assault on Rihanna, Chris Brown has been accused of a long list of crimes against numerous women over the years, which he has denied \u2013 last week he sued over how he was represented in a new documentary, with lawyers saying: \u201cMr Brown has never been found guilty of any sex related crime \u2026 but this documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.\u201d His win for best R&amp;B album, over a big breakthrough by Muni Long and another veteran in Usher, plus others, shows that he still has his backers in the Recording Academy. But there has been disquiet online \u2013 just as there has for Kanye West\u2019s red carpet appearance with his wife, Bianca Censori essentially appearing nude, the latest in a series of mute, near-undressed appearances alongside him that have provoked widespread concern for her welfare. Female artists did well \u2013 but men still dominate behind the scenes Two of the \u201cbig four\u201d were won by female artists, but when you look into the actual winners, they were overwhelmingly male. These awards are shared by the producers, songwriters, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers and while there is some heartening female representation \u2013 such as Idania Valencia who mastered Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, and songwriters such as Elizabeth Lowell Boland and songwriter of the year winner Amy Allen \u2013 analysis by Akas found that only 9% of winners in the top four categories were women. And it was a bad night for the Brits Charli xcx was the chief British representative, and she gave an instantly viral bum-wiggling, underwear-chucking live performance of Guess on the night, but she was shut out of the big prizes, making do with dance-pop awards. And it wasn\u2019t a great night for other Brits. Belfast\u2019s Jordan Adetunji was beaten to the melodic rap prize by Rapsody and Erykah Badu, Raye lost out twice, while Jacob Collier\u2019s seventh win was a minor award, for arrangement. Instead we had to rely on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones for some face-saving wins, for best rock performance and album respectively (while Sean Ono Lennon also picked up an award, for co-creating the box set release of his father\u2019s album Mind Games). \u2022 This article was updated on 3 February with a correction: Beyonce\u2019s self-titled album, not Lemonade, lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase.",

        "headline": "The 2010s are glorified by gen Z. But the \u2018indie music\u2019 of that era was unoriginal | Jamie Peck",
        "trailText": "So much of early 2000s \u2018indie\u2019 music was nothing but a backward-looking rerun of movements past",
        "bodyText": "You\u2019ve probably noticed it by now: the smeared makeup in fashion editorials, the \u201cmessy girl\u201d style of gen Z celebrities like Olivia Rodrigo, and the dance-y, LCD Soundsystem-esque sound of artists like the Dare and \u2026 well, LCD Soundsystem, whose reunited lineup seems to be playing shows every night now. The no-longer-so-niche pop star Charli xcx further foregrounded it with her breakout hit Brat this past summer, an album whose inescapable promotional cycle improbably combined an embrace by the Harris/Walz presidential campaign \u2013 cue Jake Tapper trying to explain \u201cbrat summer\u201d to your parents \u2013 and a birthday party photographed by none other than aughts-era shutter bug the Cobrasnake in his trademark high-flash, low-res style. I\u2019m talking, of course, of the aesthetic retroactively known as \u201cindie sleaze\u201d. Coined in 2021 by a Toronto Instagrammer, the term refers to the decadent, messy, dancefloor-centric music and culture of early 2000s \u2013 and stretching an undefined number of years into the 2010s \u2013 hipsterdom. (Really, we\u2019re nostalgic for things that happened years ago? What\u2019s next, 10 minutes?) Think the Strokes, Crystal Castles and Kate Moss at Glastonbury. Gen Zers may idealize it as a time before smartphones, cancel culture and fentanyl contamination took the fun and spontaneity out of being young, dumb and full of original formula Sparks. But as someone who was there, I\u2019d urge the children to look a little closer before deciding this way of life is something to celebrate. On the artistic front, indie sleaze was unoriginal. So much of early 2000s \u201cindie\u201d music (I put \u201cindie\u201d in scare quotes because most of these bands were quickly signed to major labels) was nothing but a backward-looking rerun of movements past, many of which took place in New York and London back when rent was truly cheap, the streets truly dangerous. As Dan Ozzi wrote in his review of the music journalist Lizzy Goodman\u2019s love letter to the era Meet Me in the Bathroom: Each artist \u2026 fits the mold of a bygone trope. Ryan Adams was the self-professed \u2018wannabe beat poet guy,\u2019 fitting the chain-smoking mold of folk predecessors like Bob Dylan; LCD Soundsystem saw James Murphy fusing rock sounds with electronic elements as had been covered ad nauseum [sic] through the 80s; and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 Karen O rocked the costume-heavy art-punk done 20 years prior by Wendy O and the Plasmatics. Of course, the biggest band of the era, the Strokes, and their many imitators, presented a pitch-perfect aping of New York in the 1970s, when artists like Lou Reed, Patti Smith and Television invented punk in the bombed-out remains of a disinvested city. The aughts version of this was tasteful enough, especially compared with the other rock bands of the era, but it added nothing new, and lacked the depth of the originals, issuing as it did from Bloomberg\u2019s rapidly gentrifying downtown (a process in which it soon was made complicit). A well-done retread is OK here and there, but should it inspire nostalgia for itself? Do we really want to make copies of copies until everything under the sun is just a crappier version of things that came before? I will resist the urge to date myself by citing the 1996 film Multiplicity, but my fellow elder millennials know where I\u2019m going with this. On a political level, the indie sleaze era was marked by a hedonistic nihilism that was at best naive, at worst straight up reactionary. Much like the optimistic, collectivist radicalism of the 1960s gave way to the grim, individualistic cynicism of the 1970s as barbarism triumphed over socialism, the socially conscious 1990s were obliterated by 9/11. This singular event caused such a massive political and cultural backlash that the vast majority of the American public cheered on the Bush administration as it hacked a bloody swathe through the Middle East. Tastemakers like the owners of Vice weren\u2019t going to throw their lot in with the Republicans, because that wasn\u2019t cool, but they also weren\u2019t going to stick their necks out, because they were capitalists, so they settled on a detached, postmodern whatever shrug where everything was a big joke and it was cringe to care. (It should come as no surprise that the guy doing ironic racism and sexism in the Vice dos and don\u2019ts is now an out and proud leader of the far right.) Even the Strokes were not immune; although initially meant as an \u201covertly political\u201d response to the 1999 police murder of the Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo, the ACAB anthem New York City Cops got left off the post-9/11 version of their debut album. Plenty of progressive-minded youths went along with this depoliticization, because we\u2019d just protested the Iraq war by the millions and seen it do absolutely nothing, and because we were privileged idiots who wanted to be cool. And hey, maybe the vaguely progressive-seeming new president was going to fix everything? But as we quickly learned, Barack Obama was not our savior, and no amount of partying can erase our responsibility to try to improve the world, which is demonstrably not fixing itself. On the subject of gender politics specifically, women who came of age in the post-MeToo era would be appalled by the level of misogyny that was enabled and tolerated by this crowd. I\u2019m not only talking about the images of underage-looking girls splashed across everything in an effort to market an even less empowering version of the Playboy lifestyle, but the alleged harassment that men like Terry Richardson, Dov Charney and countless less famous wannabes were accused of committing against the women who worked under them. (Charney was never actually found guilty of sexual harassment, despite the multiple allegations. Terry Richardson has been sued for sexual assault. He has denied the allegations). I will never forget signing Vice\u2019s now infamous \u201cnon-traditional workplace agreement\u201d, wherein I promised not to be offended by anything that went down \u2013 or as I like to think of it, the extremely traditional workplace agreement. Or have you not seen a show called Mad Men? I\u2019ve already written about this subject at length, so I won\u2019t dwell on it, other than to say that the stories I\u2019ve told so far are only the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019m not saying the #indiesleaze revival is uniformly bad. I love some of the music as one can only love the music from one\u2019s tumultuous youth, and I\u2019m too embarrassed to say how much I paid for tickets to see the TV on the Radio reunion. It makes me feel relevant, if old, that teens on TikTok are asking in all sincerity what it was like to see MGMT in 2009. But on the whole, I much prefer the youth culture of today, which is far more creative, socially conscious and committed to positive change than anything we had back in the days of too-tight pants and bad cocaine.",

        "trailText": "Whether making rabbits for Chappell Roan or dangling Pink upside down, these professionals build entire worlds for pop\u2019s A-listers. They explain their singular craft",
        "bodyText": "Pop star Chappell Roan has said she doesn\u2019t care about chart performance, radio play or awards, but in the lead-up to the 2025 Grammys, she appealed to witches, wiccans and others with higher power to secure just one nomination for her: best recording package, awarded for album artwork. \u201cIt\u2019s not televised, most people don\u2019t know about it, but \u2026 this means a lot to me,\u201d she said. Pleading alongside her was Ramisha Sattar, Roan\u2019s creative director. The design they submitted for Grammys consideration was a set of paper dolls Sattar conceptualised for the first-anniversary edition vinyl of The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, which can be slotted into the LP\u2019s cardboard sleeve, cut to resemble parted stage curtains. \u201cIt feels like a little craft day when you\u2019re putting them together \u2013 and that\u2019s what so much of the album behind the scenes looks like for us,\u201d says Sattar now, speaking on a video call. Sattar works with Roan not only on her album packaging but also her merchandise, marketing, stage concepts and more. Creative directors like her are becoming increasingly vital as pop stars manage the demands to produce social media content, products, blockbuster stadium tours and visually distinct \u201ceras\u201d of music. Kanye West may have established the blueprint with his collaboration with the late Virgil Abloh, while Ciarra Pardo worked with Rihanna for nearly a decade before becoming chief creative officer of the singer\u2019s company Fenty Corp. Oliver El-Khatib grew rapper Drake into a brand, October\u2019s Very Own, now synonymous with Toronto. Todd Tourso, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s long-time creative director, was instrumental in the career pivot of her 2014 \u201cvisual album\u201d, making her videos just as hotly anticipated as her music. More recently, Imogene Strauss \u2013 who has partnered with Caroline Polachek, Solange and Clairo \u2013 worked with Charli xcx on Brat, collaborating on the now-iconic shade of green for the cover and stoking the online memes that helped to turn the album into a cultural moment. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s creative director and stylist is her elder sister, Pili Vila. \u201cThey always come to the conversation with a very strong idea of what the song is about,\u201d says Nicol\u00e1s M\u00e9ndez, founder of the production company Canada, who has directed several of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s videos. Pienso en tu Mir\u00e1, a song about toxic love, inspired a concept about vampires with Spanish imagery drawn from the sisters\u2019 childhoods; TKN, about family, led to an idea for an unruly \u201cherd of kids\u201d with Rosal\u00eda as matriarch. \u201cOnce I have the concept, then it is just a matter of thinking around it, in every direction, and seeing what images come out,\u201d says M\u00e9ndez. Sattar, meanwhile, is \u201cjust as much Chappell Roan as I am\u201d, Roan has said. They started working together in 2022, after Roan came across Sattar\u2019s work and sent her a message on Instagram. Sattar designed some merchandise, then worked as a wardrobe assistant for the videos for Casual and My Kink Is Karma before joining Roan\u2019s team. Now she works closely with stylist Genesis Webb and set designer Maris Jones across all of Chappell Roan\u2019s varied output, \u201cmaking sure that there\u2019s that through line \u2026 that makes it all feel like Chappell\u201d. The briefs can be varied, including sourcing items for shoots and matching colours and fabrics to individual songs, but what makes a design or concept \u201cChappell Roan\u201d \u2013 as opposed to Sabrina Carpenter, say, or Olivia Rodrigo \u2013 \u201ccan\u2019t really be condensed down to a one-pager,\u201d says Sattar. \u201cSometimes we know exactly what we want, and sometimes the fun part is figuring it out.\u201d The first step is often a mood board. \u201cWe have a lot of fun during that moment: \u2018Let\u2019s reference this vintage thing we found at a flea, and also our favourite movie\u2019,\u201d says Sattar. The starting point for the charming lyric video for Good Luck, Babe! \u2013 which spent 14 weeks in the UK Top 5 \u2013 was imagining a teenager\u2019s enthusiasm for Microsoft PowerPoint. \u201cYou\u2019d add in these unnecessary transitions, and the colours almost hurt your eyes because you used every single one \u2013 that was kind of the vibe,\u201d Sattar says. \u201cLike, if someone made this on their laptop.\u201d At other times, the direction is suggested by lyrics. The video for Hot to Go! was inspired by its cheerleader-chant chorus and playful allusions to takeout food. The lyric \u201churry up, it\u2019s getting cold\u201d invoked red and white, says Sattar. \u201cWe referenced a lot of old napkins, pizza boxes \u2026 [and] played into the diner aesthetic.\u201d One early item of merch, a bandana showing a wand-wielding rabbit, was similarly inspired by a fan-favourite lyric from Red Wine Supernova. \u201cIt\u2019s about making stuff that you know people are going to be excited about,\u201d Sattar says. \u201cThey pick up on every little detail.\u201d Baz Halpin, chief executive and founder of production agency Silent House, agrees that a strong visual concept can help to foster loyalty and community among fans. When he began his career in the mid-90s, lighting was musicians\u2019 chief means of making a statement on stage, \u201cand video was really the realm of the very successful, wealthy performers\u201d, he says. Today, \u201caudiences are much more sophisticated\u201d, with an inexhaustible demand for content. Where details about stadium shows used to be tightly restricted, behind-the-scenes material and even setlists are now shared ahead of time, \u201cjust to feed that media machine\u201d, Halpin says. The process always starts with a conversation about what the artist is wanting to say. \u201cIt can be more than a concert \u2013 it can have a message, a narrative,\u201d Halpin says, pointing to set designer Willie Williams\u2019 work with U2, from the 1992 Zoo TV tour to 2023\u2019s Achtung Baby Live at Sphere. \u201cAny artist that is known for having a great visual presentation over multiple tours, will always have a director that they have worked with for decades.\u201d Halpin namechecks Justin Timberlake as one performer who \u201cloves the practical side\u201d of putting together a stadium spectacle \u2013 but \u201cmost do not operate on that technical level, or want to\u201d. Halpin\u2019s longest-running relationship is 20 years with Pink, who was inspired by seeing aerialists at a Cher concert to apply her own background in gymnastics to her shows. Over successive tours, Halpin has helped to develop the performance from a simple silks routine to the high-level aerial acrobatics that now define a Pink show. The moments of a performance that resonate, however, can be unexpected. \u201cLeft Shark\u201d, the much-memed backing dancer from Katy Perry\u2019s Super Bowl spectacle, was \u201cone of those happy accidents\u201d, Halpin says. \u201cIf anything, I thought the singing palm trees would get more play.\u201d But it all worked perfectly with Perry\u2019s fun-filled style of the time: \u201cAudiences can smell fakeness a miles away \u2013 it\u2019s important that you\u2019re always being true to who the artist is.\u201d The creative director\u2019s job is to help them to convey that, Halpin adds.

        "trailText": "From voters picking up \u2018bad vibes\u2019 to the Brat girl summer, vague instincts now make the world go round. Does this represent a crisis of seriousness or has it always been feelings that make us human?",
        "bodyText": "Facts were cool for about 250 years. From the Enlightenment until this century, facts were where it was at. They had a good innings. But it is game over for facts, the end of the line for statistics. These days, what counts is what you feel. In other words, it\u2019s all about the vibe. Vibes are everywhere. Disillusioned Labour voters are \u201cpicking up bad vibes\u201d, reports this paper. The Bank of England gets \u201cwrong-footed by a vibe shift in the economy\u201d. In the US, a \u201cvibe-cession\u201d \u2013 a downturn in economic confidence at an impressionistic level \u2013 was a key electoral issue. Google Maps will not only give you directions, but \u201cvibe check\u201d a neighbourhood for you. Of all this year\u2019s hit albums, the one that had a vibe named after it \u2013 Brat \u2013 won the culture, catapulting Charli XCX to seven Grammy nominations. When a new production of Romeo &amp; Juliet opened on Broadway recently, a US newspaper wrote that \u201cthe vibe is very \u2018teens hanging out in the Target parking lot\u2019, only with a lot more sonnets and glitter\u201d \u2013 because even William Shakespeare is no one without a vibe these days. Feelings have always made the world go round. The bone-deep part of being human is the stuff you feel: love, joy, grief, awe, fear, faith. Emotions start wars, drive revolutions, shape history. Marriage, a pillar of the established order at a societal level and a decision of life-shaping consequence at the individual one, is a choice for which there is really no rational basis. Still, for 250 years, in the public sphere, emotion was considered secondary to rational thinking. The accepted wisdom of the civilised world was that facts trumped feelings. Now we have had a change of heart. Facts are dead, and the vibe is king. Vibes, for so long a fundamentally unserious shorthand for 60s nostalgia, are now taken very seriously indeed. Instead of being hedonism-coded, fuzzy through a cloud of smoke, the vibe is now item No 1 on boardroom agendas worldwide. To some, this is a very bad vibe. We are in the grip of \u201ca crisis of seriousness\u201d, writes cultural critic Ted Gioia. We behave like fractious toddlers, judging the world on whether it makes us smile. We care less for good over evil than for feelgood over everything else. We expect entertainment not just from the entertainment industry, but from politicians too, and politicians have fallen in line, feeding us election campaigns sugared with TikTok memes and merch. A full 28 years after Susan Sontag warned that seriousness was \u201closing credibility \u2026 with the ascendancy of a culture whose most intelligible, persuasive values are drawn from the entertainment industries\u201d, her warnings have, some believe, come to pass. Many columnists have pivoted to writing about Taylor Swift and the Hot Rabbi, but many of those who haven\u2019t opine disapprovingly of this unseemly thirst for the transient and fluffy, unbecoming in a mature civilisation. But the facts are not black and white. A church and state boundary between facts and feelings never existed, except in our imagination. The good old days when voters pored over policy documents and made a rational choice? A figment of the imagination. Those voters divided mainly along class lines, which was at least as much about an intangible feeling of belonging as it was about economic interest. What is religion, after all, but values gift-wrapped in aesthetics and ritual? This is facetious, yes, but also sort of true, which is vibes in a nutshell. And what\u2019s more, if our faith in knowledge and detail and statistics has tanked, this is not without good reason. Chatter about vibes tracks the same trajectory as that about fake news. Fake news has devalued facts, and vibes have stepped into the vacuum. The story of vibes begins with the release of the Beach Boys\u2019 Good Vibrations in 1966. That was where the vibe chilled, for decades: West-Coast-specific, surf-adjacent, self-consciously laid-back. Quincy Jones launched Vibe magazine in 1993, when hip-hop was still a subculture, and the meaning of vibe began to expand. A graph of the word \u2018vibes\u2019 on Google Trends shows it begins to move from the alternative to the mainstream around 2016. Having hummed around the edges of culture for half a century, vibes began to gather steam. Louise Yems, strategy director of creative agency The Digital Fairy, believes the rise of vibes \u201cspeaks to how our reduced attention spans have led to a shortening of language. We use fewer words to capture something bigger than the words themselves.\u201d Sometime around the early 2010s, the media started talking about places, bands, hotels having \u201ca cool vibe\u201d, or \u201can uptown vibe\u201d. Interesting timing, says Yems, \u201cbecause Instagram was launched in 2010, and by 2013 smartphones were becoming much more common, so people were starting to interact with social media algorithms\u201d. The first modern vibe was \u201chygge\u201d, which in 2016 was shortlisted for the Oxford word of the year. (It feels relevant to note that the overall winner, that year, was the word \u201cpost-truth\u201d.) Hygge, a Danish concept defined as \u201ca quality of cosiness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or wellbeing\u201d was the subject of endless articles that attempted to skewer its ineffable aura of wintry joy with reference to earthenware mugs of steaming drinks, log fires, artfully folded blankets and expensive socks. Before hygge, vibes were bacchanalian, or youth-culture specific. Hygge was an armchair vibe, to which all ages could tap in. Then came the pandemic, which ratcheted up our lives to vibrate at a higher emotional frequency, while also moving them increasingly online. \u201cWe started talking about vibes in September 2020,\u201d says Dr Antonia Ward, chief futurist at trends intelligence company Stylus. \u201cWe were looking at how social media was reflecting a more chaotic mood. Before that, platforms such as Instagram had been quite buttoned down and filtered, but something shifted. We began sending a more impressionistic collage of how we felt, because how we felt was really complicated.\u201d The world was shifting beneath our feet, and we were feeling the vibrations. By February 2022, vibes had seeped into our vernacular to the extent that New York magazine asked \u201cA Vibe Shift is Coming. Will Any of Us Survive It?\u201d which explained: \u201cA vibe shift is the catchy but sort of too-cool term \u2026 for a relatively simple idea: in the culture, sometimes things change, and a once-dominant social wavelength starts to feel dated.\u201d Vibes, once warm and fuzzy, were now seismic tectonic plates beneath the feet of culture. From culture, vibes travelled downstream into politics \u2013 with a staging post in finance, according to Robin James, author of a forthcoming book, Good Vibes Only: Phenomenology, Algorithms and the Politics of Legitimation. \u201cCryptocurrency and NFTs [non-fungible tokens] are hype-based assets, where the value is in the vibe. They are worth what people think they are worth.\u201d Vibes began to mean dollars. NFT companies started hiring vibes managers. \u201cMy guess is that vibe migrated from finance into politics,\u201d says James. As vibes became a metric mapped on to making money, the language used about them started to change. The cultural corner-office job title, these days, is chief vibes officer, a role to which Smirnoff, the world\u2019s biggest vodka brand, has recently appointed pop singer Troye Sivan. In fashion, vibes have replaced trends rather than facts. Trends were the bread and butter of style for decades, demanding we buy a new look every six months. It was a system that worked brilliantly for a fast fashion industry which grew bloated on it; it worked significantly less well for the planet. Eventually, consumers grew tired of the game. Now, fashion is about a vibe, which is not just an aesthetic, but a whole mood. The must-have of 2024 was a Brat girl summer, and this was not available to click and buy. You could buy denim shorts, or a Brat-green bra top, but for maximum impact you needed to accessorise them with a hangover and a Bic lighter in the pocket of your denim shorts. The thrill of a vibe is that it leads with emotion, not with spending power. It feels like playing hooky from a world where we are kettled by capitalism. Before we had vibes, we had the chillier, more Germanic zeitgeist. Both tap into our appetite for locating our lives within a bigger picture. But vibes are crowd-sourced and ground-up, where the zeitgeist was ordained by experts, a trickle-down form of cultural economics. And where the zeitgeist was future-facing, a relentless drive toward modernity, vibes are more unpredictable, prone to bouts of nostalgia (cottagecore: vintage Laura Ashley dresses, dried flowers, having chickens) and whimsy (dark academia: polaroid photos of gothic architecture, writing a journal in a fountain pen). \u201cFashion is what turns a vibe into something concrete,\u201d says Tim Blanks, editor-at-large at The Business of Fashion website. \u201cThe feeling emerges, and then it gets merchandised. If the feeling is for boho, then fashion will give us a whole Laurel Canyon situation \u2013 a frilly blouse, a bit of a cowboy boot.\u201d A vibe has a mystique that a trend does not, because it is more than just visual. As Blanks says, \u201cYou can\u2019t take a picture of a vibe.\u201d The New Look with which Christian Dior dazzled the world in 1947 was brilliant in its visual comprehensibility: a wasp-waisted, full-skirted silhouette so simple that a child could draw it with a pencil. You can\u2019t sketch \u201cnormcore\u201d, or \u201cquiet luxury\u201d, or any other modern vibe. Baggy clothes are in, \u201cbut the difference between the trendy baggy look and just looking unkempt is in who\u2019s wearing it, in what way, and where\u201d, James points out. \u201cLike, are they in Brooklyn, or in the middle of Iowa?\u201d Brands now believe that a vibe adds value, even if the audience is just pressing \u201clike\u201d on Instagram and not buying anything. \u201cA vibe is invitational,\u201d says Yems. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to feel like you are part of a brand, regardless of product ownership. You can identify as a Ganni girl even if you can\u2019t afford the brand.\u201d A vibe \u201cis aesthetic, but can also be auditory, tactile, sensory\u201d, says Ward. \u201cIf I said \u2018autumn vibe\u2019, you\u2019d think: cold white sunlight over crunchy leaves, fluffy sweaters, steam rising from hot drinks. It\u2019s a broader, stretchier way to describe a moment. This has been turbocharged by generation Z\u2019s ease with fluid ideas of identity, and what Yems calls \u201ctheir general inclination toward storyboarding and romanticising their lives, which has led to the mainstreaming of vibe\u201d. Tablescaping \u2013 the vogue for curating \u201cvibey\u201d dinner tables with a combination of food, homewares, hedonism and conviviality \u2013 is a trend that feels confusing to older generations, but makes sense to generation Z, for whom cross-disciplinary identity comes naturally. In music, genre is now less important than mood. Spotify, which dominates modern listening, has made a business decision to organise songs by emotional resonance, having calculated that playlists catering to every mood and moment \u2013 \u201cindie folk playlist to give my brain a big warm hug\u201d, \u201chigh-energy songs for winter runs\u201d \u2013 keep our attention longer than old-school record rack cataloguing. Vibe-based playlists strip out signposting by tribe or taste, and organise songs to soundtrack your moods, as if your life was a movie. You can have music to get you in the mood to go out, or to calm you after a bad day. The rise of the vibe has changed not just how we listen to music, but how it is made. \u201cA genre is defined by things like instrumentation, time signature, whether there are vocals,\u201d says James. \u201cBut a vibes-based playlist instead picks up on the orientation of those elements towards a mood.\u201d James points to Spotify\u2019s \u201cchill vibes\u201d playlist, which \u201chas jazz, and R&amp;B, and Japanese electronic music by Ryuichi Sakamoto. Totally different genres. But what they have in common is that these songs are the most toned-down versions of those particular styles.\u201d Listening to the Dare\u2019s album What\u2019s Wrong With New York recently, James felt it was \u201ctrying to sound like LCD Soundsystem, but these songs are so short. There isn\u2019t time to develop those big builds and long releases of energy, but they can use elements \u2013 the attitude of the lyrics, say \u2013 to create an atmosphere, a feel.\u201d In a short-attention-span world, vibe has become a kind of musical shorthand. \u201cSongs are generally shorter now because that\u2019s what streaming platforms reward. There isn\u2019t time for a key change any more. But one thing you can do in a two-minute song is just kind of say, \u2018OK, here\u2019s the vibe.\u2019\u201d * * * Vibes predate the digital world, but technology is part of their story. It is tempting to frame vibes as the deep, mysterious business of being human resisting a technology financially incentivised to mine us for information, but vibes mirror the digital world as much as they resist it. It is no coincidence that vibes have expanded to take up space in our lives and in our culture during exactly the period in which smartphones, social media and algorithms have conspired to suck out the oxygen. James calls vibes \u201ca vernacularisation of the algorithm. A vibe is how we see ourselves the way that AI and algorithms see us. What they do is look for patterns, clusters of data points that fit together. On social media, people collect different images and put them together, in very much the same way that algorithms cluster data points.\u201d Our modern hunger for vibes, says James, \u201ctakes ownership of these new powers that have been pushed into our lives. We are surrounded by systems designed to surveil and coerce behaviour from us. Vibes are our way of learning to game that system.\u201d After all, as author and 80s TV host Arthur C Clarke said, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Vibes are both bone-deep and ephemeral nonsense. They are new and they are also ancient. They are precious fairy dust to keep the all-seeing algorithms from sinking their vampire teeth into our culture, and yet they are a modern marketing tool. When we put our faith in vibes, we feel for a moment as if we can put down our phones and navigate through life by the stars, like Renaissance sailors. Perhaps this isn\u2019t quite true, but we all need a little magic in our realism. Why kill the vibe?",
