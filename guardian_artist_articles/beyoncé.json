        "bodyText": "The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has threatened to take England away from Twickenham and move to Milton Keynes or Birmingham because of licensing restrictions after missing out on hosting lucrative Beyonc\u00e9 concerts at the stadium. Sweeney has warned that if Richmond council does not grant the RFU permission to stage more non-rugby events at Twickenham, \u201cit would be a tough call for us\u201d, with a move away from London mooted. The RFU has previously explored buying half of Wembley and a move to a greenfield site in Birmingham, an acknowledgment that Twickenham is not fit for purpose. The RFU committed ultimately to its plans to revamp Twickenham, due to begin in 2027 and which could cost up to \u00a3663m, but needs to raise revenue by hosting more music concerts. The RFU is allowed to host three non-rugby events a year and only two on consecutive nights with a limited capacity of 55,000. The union says Twickenham, which has a capacity of 82,000, is empty for 340 days a year with Sweeney claiming that, due to the restrictions, the RFU missed out on staging Beyonc\u00e9 concerts. In documents seen by the Guardian, the RFU laments how the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium can host 30 non-football events a year and Wembley 32. Beyonc\u00e9 is playing six nights at the Spurs stadium, which has taken NFL matches away from Twickenham. The RFU is lobbying Richmond council for 15 events a year at a capacity of 75,000 but Sweeney has warned that moving to Milton Keynes or Birmingham would become options again if allowances are not made. The union began discussions with the council last year and has undertaken a consultation process with three engagement events scheduled next week. \u201cPart of the renovation from 2027 means we are in discussions with Richmond borough council to stage more non-rugby events. For us it is three [events] and we are only allowed one on a Friday,\u201d Sweeney told the Business of Sport podcast. \u201cWe have had the Rolling Stones. We could have had Beyonc\u00e9 but she wanted three nights and we are only allowed two nights consecutively. \u201cWe are saying: \u2018If we are going to invest \u00a3600m into the Allianz [Stadium, Twickenham\u2019s sponsored name] \u2013 and we have a study which shows how much economic value it contributes to the borough \u2013 if we\u2019re going to do that, you are going to have to work with us in terms of an increase in the number of events we can stage in order to monetise the stadium.\u2019 There are plenty of places that would like to have us there. Birmingham, Milton Keynes would love to have us there.\u201d Asked whether the RFU would relocate if the council rejected its request, Sweeney said: \u201cIt would be a tough call for us. It would be very difficult. I don\u2019t know how we would justify the investment in the stadium if we can\u2019t get the increase in the event licences.\u201d Last year the RFU signed a 13-year \u00a3130m deal with Allianz to take over the naming rights of Twickenham. It is not clear whether that deal precludes the RFU relocating or whether any new stadium would immediately assume the sponsor\u2019s name. The RFU is due to submit planning and licensing applications in the coming weeks and expects an answer from Richmond council by September. It hopes to incrementally increase the number of non-sporting events it can stage with nine next year, 12 in 2027 and 15 in 2028. The RFU has also said it is open to hosting Six Nations matches on Friday nights if it suits broadcasters, but is understood that while the fixtures next year have not been announced, it will not do so next year. The union also wants to be able to host events such as Christmas parties until 2am as well as install an ice rink and a Christmas market.",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 is out in front with the nominations for the 67th Grammy awards in what promises to be another female-heavy year. The star has scored 11 nods for her country album Cowboy Carter with recognition in the country, pop and Americana categories. It\u2019s the biggest number of nominations she has received in a single year and she now holds the joint record of most-nominated artist ever alongside her husband, Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 is also the most awarded artist in Grammys history with 32 wins, yet has not won album of the year to date. In that category she faces competition from Andr\u00e9 3000, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Jacob Collier, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift. Following Beyonc\u00e9 with seven nominations each are Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish. Then with six each is Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. Breakout star Roan continues a highly successful year and will be one of the favourites in the new artist category alongside Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, Khruangbin, Raye, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims. The record of the year category contains The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2018Em, Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso, Charli xcx \u2013 360, Kendrick Lemar \u2013 Not Like Us, Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck Babe and Taylor Swift and Post Malone \u2013 Fortnight. The song of the year category includes Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy), Billie Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019s Die with a Smile, Taylor Swift and Post Malone\u2019s Fortnight, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck Babe, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Please Please Please and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2018Em. The dance categories also saw recognition for Justice, Troye Sivan and Disclosure while the rock categories were led by The Black Keys and Green Day. The controversial star Chris Brown, who was the subject of a new documentary detailing various allegations of abuse and sexual assault, was featured prominently in the R&amp;B categories alongside Muni Long and Lucky Daye. Lamar was the most-nominated rap artist and faces competition in those categories from Eminem and J Cole. Dolly Parton, Jimmy Carter and Barbra Streisand also feature in the unusual line-up for this year\u2019s audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais are featured in the comedy album line-up. The recording academy\u2019s CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, called music a \u201cpowerful force for good\u201d in his introduction to today\u2019s announcement. The awards are voted on by a body of 13,000 members. No new categories were added for the first time in four years. Earlier this year, Taylor Swift became the first artist to win album of the year for the fourth time, taking home the award for Midnights. The 67th Grammy awards will take place on 2 February 2025 with a host for the ceremony yet to be announced.",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar ruled the Grammys during a night that also paid tribute to those affected by the California wildfires. The night\u2019s biggest prize, for album of the year, went to Beyonc\u00e9 for Cowboy Carter, the first time she has won the award. It was presented by members of the Los Angeles country fire department in one of many of the night\u2019s tributes to those affected by the wildfires. The ceremony took place at the Crypto.com arena in LA. The singer is only the fourth Black woman to win the award. \u201cIt\u2019s been many many years,\u201d she said to loud applause. A visibly shocked Beyonc\u00e9 also won for best country album, saying she \u201creally was not expecting this\u201d as she accepted the award. \u201cSometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists and I just want to encourage people to do what they\u2019re passionate about,\u201d she said. She was given the award by Taylor Swift. \u201cI will never forget standing here almost exactly 15 years ago,\u201d she said while looking back on her win in this category. Beyonc\u00e9, who also won for best country duo performance with Miley Cyrus, became the first Black woman to win a country Grammy for 50 years. Chris Stapleton took home the award for best country solo performance. Lamar won five awards for his controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us, which is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit. He took home both song and record of the year. During one of his speeches, Lamar, who is performing at next week\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, said he wanted to \u201cdedicate this one to the city\u201d. After last year saw Taylor Swift, SZA, Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish dominate, this year saw another strong female showing with Beyonc\u00e9, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Doechii and Chappell Roan winning many of the major awards. In the competitive best new artist category, Chappell Roan beat out Shaboozey, Raye, Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter. She used her speech to call on the industry to \u201coffer a livable wage and healthcare especially to emerging artists\u201d before telling the story of how she struggled to survive in her early days as a musician. \u201cLabels, we got you but do you got us?\u201d she asked. Charli xcx picked up three awards in the pop categories but lost out on pop solo performance and pop vocal album to Sabrina Carpenter. Doechii won for best rap album, becoming only the third woman to do so. Other female winners included SZA who picked up best R&amp;B song for Saturn, St Vincent who took home best alternative music album, best rock song and best alternative music performance, Kacey Musgraves who picked up best country song for The Architect and Shakira who won best Latin pop album. The Colombian singer dedicated her award to \u201call my immigrant brothers and sisters\u201d. Jimmy Carter was also a posthumous winner for the audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Chris Brown were controversial picks for comedy album and R&amp;B album respectively. Host Trevor Noah began the night by referring to the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances that have changed the tone and motivation of this year\u2019s awards. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest national disasters in American history,\u201d he said while speaking about the devastating California wildfires and calling attention to the spirit of those who have endured. To kick off the show, he introduced Dawes, a band who have lost homes and instruments as a result of the fires. They have also helped raise money for nearly 100 other families. They were joined by artists including John Legend, Sheryl Crow and St Vincent for a special performance paying tribute to Los Angeles. Noah drew attention to a number of charities and organisations, telling those in the room and viewers at home that there would be a QR code which would allow people to contribute. He later said that Amazon Music, CBS and Mastercard had donated. He also said the night would highlight local businesses affected by the fires with the venue both catered and decorated by some and with a certain amount of advertising space given to others. While presenting the award for song of the year, Diana Ross said: \u201cMay this moment remind us all of the power we hold to rebuild, to lift and to come together with compassion.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars performed a duet of California Dreamin\u2019 after a montage highlighting Californians who had lost their homes in the fires. The pair later won the best pop duo performance award for their song Die with a Smile. In her acceptance speech, she said: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d Noah had a number of jabs at the returning US president, joking that millions of immigrants were also part of this year\u2019s voting body. When speaking about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s just-announced tour, he joked: \u201cThere\u2019s tariffs, we can\u2019t afford a new tour! Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Alicia Keys was given the Dr Dre global impact award and spoke to the importance of diversity in music. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry,\u201d she said. She also added that \u201cthis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices\u201d and that \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift\u201d. Other performances throughout the night included Billie Eilish who ended her performance saying \u201cI love LA\u201d, Sabrina Carpenter who sang a rejigged and physically comedic take on her hits Espresso and Please Please Please, Chappell Roan who was introduced by Olivia Rodrigo (the Vampire singer called her \u201cmy extraordinary friend\u201d) and a surprise appearance from the Weeknd who had previously pledged a permanent boycott of the Grammys. His performance was introduced by the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who spoke about the many structural changes he had helped implement which then lured the Weeknd back. There was also a star-studded tribute to Quincy Jones who died last year. Will Smith, making his first appearance on a major televised awards ceremony since the infamous slap, called Jones \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our time\u201d in an introduction to a performance that featured Janelle Monae, Herbie Hancock, Cynthia Erivo and Stevie Wonder, who led a rendition of We Are the World with a choir wearing special LA sweaters. Smith explained that the singers represented two schools that had been lost in the fires. Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin also sang an accompaniment to this year\u2019s in memoriam section which included late stars including Liam Payne, Kris Kristofferson, Cissy Houston, Marianne Faithfull, Bob Newhart, Wayne Osmond and S\u00e9rgio Mendes. Last year saw Taylor Swift become the first artist to win album of the year four times but tonight she went home empty-handed despite six nominations. Other nominees who left without any awards included Shaboozey, Post Malone, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish.",

        "trailText": "This freewheeling embrace of the singer\u2019s roots was also a triumphant reclamation of a genre that had long shunned its Black origins ",
        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 weaves Cowboy Carter\u2019s origin story into the album\u2019s opening track, Ameriican Requiem. Against a psychedelic country-gospel backdrop that unfolds with both determination and frustration, she establishes her southern roots \u2013 Alabama, Texas, Louisiana \u2013 but notes this background hasn\u2019t always been respected: \u201cUsed to say I spoke too country / And the rejection came, said I wasn\u2019t country \u2019nough.\u201d It was a literal story. In November 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 drew criticism (and overt racism) from country purists after an exuberant performance of her Lemonade track Daddy Lessons with the Chicks at the Country Music awards. A month later, she received a stinging rebuke from the music industry when the Grammys refused to nominate the song in country categories. The subtext was clear: many people refused to accept a Black woman playing country music \u2013 and had no interest in hearing Beyonc\u00e9 out. Ameriican Requiem touches directly on this exclusion, pointing out the failed (and narrow) promise of the American experiment (\u201cthem big ideas are buried here\u201d) and the superficial good manners that uphold the racist status quo: \u201cYou change your name, but not the ways you play pretend.\u201d But this gatekeeping only galvanised Beyonc\u00e9, and she created Cowboy Carter \u2013 the second album in her three-act Renaissance trilogy \u2013 to carve out a space in country music on her own terms. This being Beyonc\u00e9, Cowboy Carter was no straightforward Nashville record. Instead, in keeping with the sprawling ambition of the auteurist albums she has been releasing for the past decade, it wrapped its arms around the entire American music vernacular: the 1960s soul/R&amp;B homage Ya Ya makes pointed comments about American prosperity (or lack thereof) while interpolating both Nancy Sinatra\u2019s These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 and the Beach Boys\u2019 Good Vibrations. The Shaboozey collaboration Sweet Honey Buckiin\u2019, meanwhile, is a dizzying combination of R&amp;B twang and hip-hop. In contrast, the torchy standout II Most Wanted is more traditional, emerging as a Fleetwood Mac-referencing duet with a smoky-voiced Miley Cyrus. The towering ballad 16 Carriages features a weary protagonist looking back on hard times and moments of innocence lost, while the bouncy 70s Laurel Canyon throwback Bodyguard is a sweet ode to buffering a partner from danger. Beyonc\u00e9 also wasn\u2019t afraid to tackle country\u2019s iconic moments, notably recasting Dolly Parton\u2019s Jolene as a steely eyed warning shot that jettisoned the vulnerability of the original song. But it was her attempts to shape country in her own image and foreground its Black origins that felt especially fresh and thrilling: Parton and Willie Nelson made lighthearted cameos; more significantly, greater deference was afforded to Black country musicians. The pioneering country artist Linda Martell received several spotlights; global hit Texas Hold \u2019Em featured the lithe banjo of Rhiannon Giddens. The brief interlude Smoke Hour Willie Nelson took the form of a radio dial flipping through songs by Son House, Chuck Berry and Sister Rosetta Tharpe \u2013 a subtle nod to the fact Black artists invented country and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. And where Grammy voters had adhered to purist lines, Beyonc\u00e9 stretched a hand across history and genre with a cover of the Beatles\u2019 Blackbird, a song that Paul McCartney envisioned as a beacon of hope for the US civil rights movement. In response, Beyonc\u00e9 and a choir of voices \u2013 comprising Black country artists Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts, Tanner Adell, and Tiera Kennedy \u2013 answer McCartney\u2019s song with strength, tenderness and appreciation. Cowboy Carter became the first ever UK No 1 country album by a Black artist, setting the pace for a year when country songs infiltrated the British pop charts for the first time since the 90s (Dasha\u2019s Austin, Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy), the Morgan Wallen and Post Malone duet I Had Some Help), and stars including Diplo and pop supernova Chappell Roan kept the genre vibrant. Last month, it also scored Beyonc\u00e9 four nods in country music categories at the Grammys, out of 11 overall nominations (although it was snubbed again at the Country Music awards in September). \u201cThey don\u2019t know how hard I had to fight for this / When I sang my song,\u201d she sings on Ameriican Requiem. The depth of knowledge and the conviction of performance on Cowboy Carter are a clear testament not just to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fight, but her intimacy with the genre. Clearly, the mindset of listeners and most awards voters has expanded to encompass her since 2016 \u2013 but rather than revel in vindication, you\u2019d bet on Beyonc\u00e9 focusing her energies on Renaissance Act III, riding off into the sunset in search of new territory to conquer.",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 has announced a stadium tour for her foray into country music, Cowboy Carter, including four dates at London\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The tour spans 22 dates, chiefly in the US, beginning in Los Angeles\u2019s SoFi Stadium on 28 April before heading to Chicago, East Rutherford, Houston (her home city), Washington DC and Atlanta. The four London dates begin 5 June, followed by two at Paris\u2019s Stade de France. The news comes the day after the Grammy awards, where Cowboy Carter was named album of the year and best country album, while the track II Most Wanted, a duet with Miley Cyrus, won best country duo/group performance. It extended Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s record as the most awarded artist in Grammys history, with 35 wins from 99 nominations. The tour announcement had long been anticipated, and was postponed following the wildfires in Los Angeles. Beyonc\u00e9 gave the world a high-profile preview of how Cowboy Carter\u2019s material will play out live, in a Christmas Day half-time show during an NFL game in Houston. Featuring special guests including Post Malone, Shaboozey and her daughter Blue Ivy, she ran through a medley of Cowboy Carter tracks complete with live brass sections and dozens of dancers. The album is the second part of a mooted trilogy beginning with Renaissance in 2022, which explored house music and other club-focused styles. Beyonc\u00e9 toured that album and documented the making of it in a self-directed film of the same name. Comprising 56 shows across Europe and north America, it became her highest-grossing tour, bringing in $579m in revenue. Beyonc\u00e9 is employing multiple pre-sales before tickets go on general sale. The first is for existing members of her Beyhive fan club, beginning 11 February. Those who aren\u2019t already signed up can register by 6 February for an \u201cartist presale\u201d, which begins 13 February. On 12 February are a series of sponsored pre-sales, for US customers of Verizon and Citi, and UK and French Mastercard customers. The general sale begins 14 February.",

        "bodyText": "The NFL Christmas games are taking place on, you guessed it, Christmas. And if you\u2019re anything like millions of people around the world then you\u2019re probably wondering: what time does the Beyonc\u00e9 show begin? But is that all you really need to know? What about the sporty bits? The odds of a Taylor Swift sighting? And how long you\u2019ll have to stream it on Netflix before it disappears? Read on for all the answers \u2026 What time is kickoff for Chiefs v Steelers? The kickoff time for the Kansas City v Pittsburgh game at Acrisure Stadium is 1pm ET (6pm GMT). But you\u2019ll want to get to the couch about 10 minutes early if you\u2019re interested in seeing Mariah Carey perform a special pre-taped version of her 16-time platinum single All I Want for Christmas Is You. Will Taylor Swift be there? The tabs are reporting Taylor and All-Pro boyfriend Travis Kelce will be spending the holiday together with both of their families. So it\u2019s a safe bet she\u2019ll be at the stadium on Wednesday, possibly alongside field hockey coach and Rogan-toppling podcaster Kylie Kelce. What time is kickoff for Ravens v Texans? The kickoff time for the Baltimore v Houston matchup at NRG Stadium is 4.30pm ET (9.30pm GMT). And the streets are saying an all-conquering pop star might be at that game as well. How can I watch or stream the NFL Christmas Day games? The broadcast will stream live globally on Netflix starting with a pre-game show at 11am ET (4pm GMT) at no additional cost to subscribers. Additionally, the games will be carried on free-to-air CBS in the competing teams\u2019 cities and on US mobile devices with NFL+. How much did Netflix pay for NFL Christmas games? And why are they getting into live sports? Netflix has signed a three-year agreement with the NFL to exclusively stream Christmas Day games from 2024 through 2026. The streamer is paying approximately $75m per game in the first year. CBS Sports has been tapped to produce the broadcasts on a one-year contract. What does Netflix get for their $150m? For starters, in a media landscape where TV ratings are falling off across the board, live sports continue to buck the trend. That\u2019s caught the attention of media and tech giants like Amazon (who bought into the NFL) and Apple (who bought Messi), amid several other billion-dollar bets on sports programming as a driver for subscriptions. In addition to the NFL games, Netflix has engaged in other live sports ventures, including last month\u2019s boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, a 10-year broadcasting deal with WWE valued at $5bn, The Netflix Cup (a golf pro-am with F1 drivers) and The Netflix Slam (a tennis exhibition between Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal in Las Vegas). Can a streamer handle live sports? Netflix\u2019s ability to handle live NFL Christmas games will be a major test of its streaming infrastructure. While the platform has a strong record in on-demand streaming and some experience with live events like Chris Rock: Selective Outrage, the NFL games bring unique challenges, including massive simultaneous viewership and real-time delivery. The Christmas Day games are expected to draw many millions of viewers, pushing Netflix\u2019s scalability and reliability to the limit. Any buffering, lags or outages, such as what happened during the Paul v Tyson stream, could harm its reputation. How many people watched last year\u2019s NFL Christmas games? The 2023 NFL Christmas Day tripleheader drew an average of 28.7m viewers across three games, a 29% increase from the previous year\u2019s 22.2m average. The Raiders v Chiefs game at 1pm on CBS and Nickelodeon attracted 29.6m viewers, making it the second most-watched NFL Christmas game on record. The Giants v Eagles game at 4.30pm on FOX followed with 29.0m viewers, while the primetime Ravens v 49ers game at 8.15pm ET on ABC and ESPN+ drew 27.6m viewers. Each game ranked among the top five most-watched NFL Christmas Day games since 1988, showcasing the league\u2019s growing ability to capture holiday audiences. When does the Beyonc\u00e9 halftime show start? And what game is it in the middle of? Beyonc\u00e9 is scheduled to perform during half-time of second game between the Ravens and Texans. The show is expected to start approximately 90 minutes after kickoff, so around 6pm ET. Why Beyonc\u00e9? Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s half-time gig is a strategic collaboration that highlights her ties to her Houston hometown, leveraging her star power to enhance the event\u2019s pan-cultural appeal. This aligns with the NFL\u2019s goal of blending sports and entertainment to maximize holiday viewership. Of course Beyonc\u00e9 is no stranger to the NFL\u2019s grand stage. In 2013, she delivered a show-stopping halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, where she was joined by Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams for a memorable Destiny\u2019s Child reunion. Three years later, at Super Bowl 50, Beyonc\u00e9 returned to the field alongside Coldplay and Bruno Mars, captivating an audience of 115.5m households. Only true Beyhivers will remember her first NFL performance: with Destiny\u2019s Child at half-time of a 1998 preseason game between the Giants and Jets at the Meadowlands when she was 16. What is she expected to perform? The show will serve as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first live showcase of songs from her album Cowboy Carter. Details have been scarce, but the oddsmakers have priced joint-lead single Texas Hold \u2018Em as a heavy favorite to open her set. The prospect of special guests has been teased, so don\u2019t be surprised if Shaboozey or Dolly Parton makes a cameo. How can I watch the Beyonc\u00e9 replay? You don\u2019t have to watch Beyonc\u00e9 (or the football) as it happens, but plan accordingly. In the United States, the Christmas Day broadcast will disappear from the platform three hours after the livestream ends. Outside in the US, it will expires 24 hours after the livestream ends.",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 has starred in her first music video since 2021, cosplaying as Pamela Anderson and calling on Americans to vote. The video, entitled Beywatch, is soundtracked by Bodyguard, a track from her country-leaning album Cowboy Carter which was released in March. It carries \u2013 rather belatedly \u2013 the caption Happy Beylloween, but is also timed for release as Americans go to the polls. Wearing a platinum blond wig and dressing up as Anderson\u2019s characters from Baywatch and Barb Wire, in one scene Beyonc\u00e9 holds up a toy gun firing out a flag with the word \u201cVote!\u201d on it. Beyonc\u00e9 has already made her feelings known about whom the electorate should be voting for. She allowed Kamala Harris to use her song Freedom as a soundtrack to her campaign, then officially endorsed her at a rally in Houston in October, describing Harris to the 30,000-strong crowd as \u201ca woman who has been pushing for what this country really needs right now \u2026 I\u2019m here as a mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in, a world where we have freedom to control our bodies, a world where we are not divided \u2013 our past, our present, our future meet us here.\u201d The Pamela Anderson get-up is actually Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s fourth fancy dress costume of the Halloween season, having previously been photographed as Bette Davis, and then characters from the film Purple Rain as originally played by Prince and Apollonia Kotero. Beyonc\u00e9 has directed or co-directed a number of her music videos herself, while ones for songs such as Formation and Single Ladies are seen as some of the most iconic in recent pop culture. But some fans have been frustrated by a lack of videos for her last two album projects, Cowboy Carter and Renaissance, particularly as lavish visuals were created for the latter\u2019s world tour but never used in music videos. Beyonc\u00e9 instead wrote and directed a documentary/concert film hybrid that followed the preparations and performances on the tour. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2024 to correct the spelling of Bette Davis\u2019s first name.",

        "bodyText": "Patrick Mahomes passed for 320 yards and three touchdowns and the Kansas City Chiefs locked up the top seed in the AFC for the fourth time in seven seasons with a 29-10 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Wednesday. The two-time defending Super Bowl champions raced to an early 13-point lead and were never really threatened by the Steelers (10-6), who have dropped three straight as their chances of capturing the AFC North took another hit. Mahomes connected on first-half scoring tosses to Xavier Worthy and Justin Watson and Kansas City\u2019s defense did most of the rest even with perennial All-Pro defensive end Chris Jones sitting out while nursing a calf injury. The Chiefs sacked Russell Wilson five times, forced two turnovers and hardly looked gassed while playing for the third time in 11 days. Travis Kelce caught eight passes for 84 yards while becoming the third tight end in NFL history to reach 1,000 receptions, joining Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten. Kelce sealed Kansas City\u2019s fifth straight victory with a 12-yard touchdown grab early in the fourth quarter. The 35-year-old celebrated by dunking the ball over the goal post, which drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and groans from a capacity crowd at Acrisure Stadium that has grown used to seeing Mahomes toy with the hometown team. Mahomes is now 4-0 against the Steelers in his career, with 17 touchdowns against one interception. Russell Wilson threw for 205 yards for Pittsburgh. George Pickens finished with three receptions for 50 yards after missing three games with a hamstring injury. It wasn\u2019t nearly enough for the Steelers, who went 0-3 during a brutal three-game stretch against Super Bowl contenders Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City. Baltimore Ravens 31-2 Houston Texans Lamar Jackson broke the NFL career rushing record for quarterbacks in Baltimore\u2019s 31-2 victory over Houston on Wednesday, bolstering his case for MVP as the Ravens moved closer to the AFC North title. Jackson threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 87 yards and another score. He pushed his career rushing total to 6,110 to move past Michael Vick, who had 6,109 in his 13-year career. The Ravens (11-5) have already wrapped up their third straight playoff berth and need a victory over Cleveland next week to win the division over Pittsburgh. Jackson, the MVP last season and in 2019, put on a show rivaled only by the spectacular Super Bowl-caliber halftime performance by Beyonc\u00e9 to give Baltimore their third straight win. And he needed just more than three quarters to do it, giving way to Josh Johnson with about 10 minutes left and the game long decided. Jackson threw nine- and one-yard TD passes and was not touched on a 48-yard scoring scamper that made it 24-2 in the third quarter. Derrick Henry ran for 147 yards and set the Ravens season record with his 16th touchdown on a two-yard run in the first quarter. He eclipsed Ray Rice (2011) and Mark Ingram (2019). Baltimore dominated a Houston team reeling after losing dynamic receiver Tank Dell to a season-ending knee injury Saturday. The AFC South champs struggled to finish drives and got their only points on a safety in the second quarter. CJ Stroud threw for 185 yards, but was sacked five times and threw an interception and Joe Mixon managed just 26 yards rushing as the Texans (9-7) lost a second straight. Beyonc\u00e9 highlights Netflix\u2019s NFL debut Beyonc\u00e9 provided more excitement than either game during Netflix\u2019s NFL debut on Christmas. Riding into her halftime appearance on a white horse, the 32-time Grammy winner rocked her hometown Houston crowd with a nearly 13-minute performance on Wednesday. She surprised fans by bringing along Shaboozey to perform Sweet Honey Buckiin and Post Malone joined her for Levii\u2019s Jeans. The action on the field didn\u2019t live up to expectations as the NFL showcased four of the AFC\u2019s top five teams. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce exposed a glitch in Pittsburgh\u2019s defense during Kansas City\u2019s 29-10 rout in the first game. The broadcast itself went off just fine, quickly becoming the second-most popular live title on Netflix to date, according to NFL Media. Lamar Jackson and the Ravens led CJ Stroud and the Texans to 17-2 at halftime before Beyonc\u00e9 stole the show. Mariah Carey opened Wednesday\u2019s doubleheader with a taped performance of All I Want for Christmas is You and then the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs trounced the Steelers to clinch the No 1 seed in the AFC. There were no signs of any major streaming issues during the game after Netflix experienced minor blunders at the start of the pregame show. The broadcast opened with roughly 10 seconds of silence because it appeared studio host Kay Adams\u2019 microphone wasn\u2019t turned on. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s live performance at NRG Stadium was supposed to be the biggest test for the streaming giant and it seemed to go off without a hitch. Netflix agreed to a three-year contract in May to broadcast Christmas Day games. The NFL is expected to give the streaming service one of its biggest days since the site launched in 1998. Netflix\u2019s 282.3m subscribers in more than 190 countries could stream the games, marking the first time one outlet distributed an NFL game globally. Netflix had the games available in five languages \u2013 English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German. Netflix had problems streaming the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight on 14 November. The bout peaked at 65m concurrent streams, including 38m concurrent streams in the United States. According to the website Down Detector, nearly 85,000 viewers logged problems with outages or streaming leading up to and during the fight. According to NFL Media, viewers in all 50 states tuned in within minutes of the pregame show going live and viewers from nearly 200 countries watched the first game. Before the Ravens-Texans kicked off, Netflix reported that it eclipsed its peak concurrent viewers of any Christmas in the past four years. The NFL was playing its first games on a Wednesday since the Steelers and Ravens were forced to play on 2 December 2020, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The only other time the league played on a Wednesday since 1948 was in 2012 when the Giants and Cowboys met in the season opener. Netflix promoted its own programming in addition to the usual slew of advertisements. The first teaser trailer for Happy Gilmore 2 was released before kickoff. Adam Sandler is back as Happy Gilmore for the sports comedy that hits the streaming service in 2025. Travis Kelce also was featured in a trailer filled with cameos by celebrities, including Bad Bunny and Kid Cudi. This wasn\u2019t the first time NFL games aired exclusively on a streaming service. The league\u2019s Thursday night games are in their third season on Amazon Prime Video, Peacock streamed the Packers-Eagles game in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in Week 1 and Prime Video will stream a wild-card game. Also, the Sunday Ticket package moved to YouTube TV last year. The largest audience for a streamed-exclusive NFL game was 23m on Peacock for last season\u2019s AFC wild-card game between the Miami Dolphins and the Chiefs.",

        "trailText": "Kamala Harris has pulled out a string of A-listers as her campaign peaks, but will it make a difference for voters?",
        "bodyText": "The 2024 presidential election is, as best as anyone can tell from the inexact art of polling, essentially a toss-up. No one knows who is going to win on Tuesday (and we probably won\u2019t know for a while afterwards, for that matter). In lieu of any definitive edge in numbers, both prognosticators and casual observers are resorting to vibes \u2013 that amorphous, indefinable and personal sense of who has the momentum, where the energy is shifting, what feels true. And for the candidates, one guaranteed way to assert a vibe \u2013 albeit maybe not the one they intended \u2013 is to recruit arguably the defining element of modern American politics: celebrity. In the past two weeks alone, both Trump and Harris have assembled their respective famous avengers (including in Harris\u2019s case, the actual Avengers), to stump for their campaign. Harris, unsurprisingly, boasts far more and higher-profile endorsements, including but not limited to: Taylor Swift, LeBron James, George Clooney, Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Marc Anthony, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tyler Perry, Usher, Lizzo, Eminem and the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who released a video this week rebuking the racist comments made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden. During the final weeks of the campaign, Harris was joined on the trail by Beyonc\u00e9, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Maggie Rogers, Willie Nelson, Jennifer Lopez and Oprah, among others. What to make of the roster? On the one hand, it suggests a level of popular enthusiasm for Harris in strong contrast to Trump, who has trotted out his usual stable of ex-wrestlers and a handful of actors. Celebrities joining the Trump campaign in the past month include Kid Rock, Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, Dennis Quaid, Zachary Levi, the rapper Kodak Black, Dr Phil, the former NFL quarterback Brett Favre and country singer Jason Aldean. Celebrity endorsements are one way to measure the vibes in an election whose polls are too close \u2013 and, for a large swath of the electorate either scarred or delighted by 2016, too untrustworthy \u2013 to reasonably make out the frontrunner, and on the level of star power, Harris certainly has the edge. But a bulwark of celebrity support also presents what Shamira Ibrahim, writing for the Guardian just after Swift\u2019s much-coveted endorsement in September, called a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d of Hollywood glitz. Endorsements may gin up enthusiasm among a star\u2019s fanbase, but they also play into Republicans\u2019 arguments that Democrats are the party of the coastal elites. (It should be noted, however, that Trump, a celebrity by trade, has not shied away from any semi-famous endorsement, even posting an AI deepfake Swift endorsement that she later condemned.) It also gives the impression of desperation \u2013 either on behalf of the campaign or the celebrities \u2013 for relevancy in an election that has been relatively light on substantive issues (again, an unfair double standard for the Trump campaign, but a complaint lodged by many in Harris\u2019s own party). As Harris has stumped for her expanded child tax credit, building back the middle class, restoring reproductive freedoms and \u201cnot going back\u201d, many headlines have focused on her guests \u2013 the beatific presence of Beyonc\u00e9 chief among them, giving uncanny flashbacks to the final self-satisfied days of Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. All this celebrity speechifying, while there is still little evidence to support the notion that celebrity endorsements make much of a difference. The gold standard example of celebrity influence remains Oprah supporting Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 her first presidential endorsement, credited with bringing in about 1m votes for the then-Illinois senator. But that was during the Democratic primary, when engaged Democratic voters were largely deciding between Obama and Clinton, not the general election between Obama and John McCain. For general elections, celebrity effect remains difficult to quantify, and more or less minor. According to a recent YouGov survey, only 11% of Americans report that a celebrity has caused them to reconsider their stance on a political issue, and only 7% say an endorsement has led them to vote for a certain candidate. Democrats are far more likely to say that celebrities weighing in on politics helps democracy, though still less than half of them do \u2013 41% compared with 12% for independents and 7% for Republicans. Where celebrities can make a difference is in attracting fundraising, attention and participation, if not necessarily shifting a vote. After Swift posted her endorsement of Harris in September, 406,000 people clicked her link to Vote.gov, which directs people to state voting websites (though it\u2019s unknown how many followed through and actually registered). A 2024 study by the Harvard Kennedy School found that celebrities can increase voter registration or poll worker signups with their platforms, particularly for younger voters disillusioned with older voices or institutions. One cited example was when Kylie Jenner posted a non-partisan voter registration link in 2020; the site later reported a 1,500% increase in traffic compared with the day before and an 80% increase in total users registering to vote. As David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, put it to CBS 58: \u201cOverall, celebrities would like to think they could influence voter behavior, but they are more valuable as fundraising tools and door-opening opportunities to their followers.\u201d Registering to vote is, while not nothing, also not the same as actually going to vote, let alone voting for a celebrity\u2019s preferred candidate. But when the election may come down to a handful of counties in a few states, in an election projected to feature record voter turnout from gen Z, the vibe is urgent. There\u2019s a sense of desperation, trying to get every single voter over the finish line \u2013 maybe a Maggie Rogers fan in Michigan, or a Beyonc\u00e9 fan in Houston, or a secretly Harris-leaning woman moved by Julia Roberts\u2019s ad, although it\u2019s admittedly hard to fathom how a voter either undecided or tuned out would 1) pay attention to just the rally with said celebrity or 2) seriously reconsider not voting for Trump because of it. (In reverse, it\u2019s hard to imagine the Hogan or Quaid diehards on the fence, but maybe they exist!) In the end, given the lack of evidence \u2013 yet \u2013 on a celebrity actually getting people to vote their way, the meaning of all these endorsements goes back to vibes. Maybe Harris\u2019s overwhelming advantage in celebrity firepower feels like an actual advantage, maybe it feels ominously out of touch. Whether you view the endorsements as a good thing or an omen is, in these final days of the campaign, really just how you feel.",

        "trailText": "Show livestreamed on Netflix is first live performance of material from country-themed album Cowboy Carter",
        "bodyText": "Some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most iconic moments have been on an American football field. Her barnstorming 2013 Super Bowl performance, complete with a Destiny\u2019s Child reunion, was outdone by her guest appearance during Coldplay\u2019s 2016 half-time show as she paid homage to the Black Panthers and freaked out a sizeable section of the US establishment (\u201cIt is now \u2018cool\u2019 to embrace violence, mayhem and, frankly, even racial separatism in the cause of civil rights,\u201d the rightwing Heritage Foundation thinktank fumed at the time). Her 2018 Coachella performance, Homecoming, though not on a football field, featured college football\u2019s majorettes and marching bands as she celebrated historically Black colleges and universities. On Wednesday \u2013 in a Christmas Day half-time show streamed on Netflix from her native Houston as the Texans played the Baltimore Ravens \u2013 she again used a football game as somewhere for her to interrogate and play around with American iconography. Beyonc\u00e9 is part of the football business: since 2019 her husband Jay-Z\u2019s company Roc Nation has partnered with the NFL to book half-time entertainment and guide its social justice initiatives. (Though Jay-Z has faced criticism in the role for aligning with an industry that shut out Colin Kaepernick after his taking-the-knee protests against racially motivated violence.) There\u2019s also the latent sense that Beyonc\u00e9 plays to win, an artist as devoted as an elite sportsperson to improving her craft, and who, like an elite sportsperson, is the subject of endless fan debates about who is the greatest of all time. The Christmas Day performance is the first live outing for material from Cowboy Carter, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2024 album that added a whole new discipline: country music. She begins with a recorded segment riding a white horse and wearing a cowboy hat so broad that it could have its own postcode, singing 16 Carriages as she passes people standing on horseback, acknowledging the tradition of African American horse riding clubs around the American south and indeed countrywide. Part of the Cowboy Carter project has been to firmly underline the contribution of Black Americans to country music and culture (not convincing everyone), and so it is here \u2013 next up is her cover of the Beatles\u2019 Blackbird, with a quartet of Black country backing singers. Any solemnity is swept away as the in-stadium performance begins with Ya Ya, a song whose total effusiveness can grate in its studio version but is transformed live. Beyonc\u00e9 has occasionally been guilty of stiffness or boring regality in live performance, but she noticeably loosened up on the Renaissance world tour and continues to be thrillingly rangy here. She prowls down bleachers filled with brass players and dancers, her eyes bugging out, her hands mock-testifying, her moves gleeful and antic in the manner of Black artists from Little Richard to Janelle Mona\u00e9. Half-time shows are always stuffed harder than the day\u2019s turkeys, but this quickly becomes a veritable turducken of hits: a megamix that pulls in My House then Riiverdance then Sweet Honey Buckiin\u2019 with special guest Shaboozey. It feels a little ungenerous then to not give him even a brief blast of the year\u2019s defining Black country anthem, A Bar Song (Tipsy). A bit more space is given to Levii\u2019s Jeans, as Beyonc\u00e9 and Post Malone sing while mooching around a denim-upholstered pickup truck. The whiff of branding thus intensifies, and some might find the way they lean into this song\u2019s cornpone melodies to be close to mockery of the genre, but it is self-knowing and charming enough in its silliness. A banner proclaims we\u2019re in the middle of a \u201cho-ho-ho down\u201d, and it continues with her cover of Jolene. Even Beyonc\u00e9 stans struggle to get behind this version, which egregiously changes the original\u2019s dynamic. Beyonc\u00e9 lets her imperiousness get the better of her; she simply won\u2019t be vulnerable and beg in the way Parton did, and instead merely issues threats. Live, the marching band drummers and brass sound terrific and give it some razzle dazzle, but there is so much to take in as lasso tricks are done in the background while Beyonc\u00e9 cruises in a lowrider. It hardly suits this bruised American standard. Everyone is at least in place, though, for a triumphant ending, with Texas Hold \u2019Em proving gorgeously contradictory: there\u2019s something down-home and comforting about its beat, like a gentle thwack on the hide of a trusty old horse. Only here it\u2019s being done here with dozens of musicians and dancers, including, by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s side, her daughter Blue Ivy. The brilliant whiteness of everyone\u2019s garb is dazzling and straightforwardly theatrical, but perhaps there\u2019s also a wink at how her all-black outfits were received back in 2016. At the end she\u2019s held aloft, the word \u201cBang!\u201d unfurled beneath her as if from a cartoon pistol. That playfulness \u2013 poking fun at cowboys, even emasculating them \u2013 is what riles some country fans, who see Beyonc\u00e9 as a tourist. But that playfulness is also what\u2019s making her live shows such a blast these days.",

        "trailText": "New class is latest to explore a pop icon\u2019s impact, with other universities offering courses on Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga",
        "bodyText": "Students at Yale University are getting the chance to take a class entirely devoted to Beyonc\u00e9, school officials have announced. The class \u2013 titled Beyonc\u00e9 Makes History: Black Radical Tradition History, Culture, Theory &amp; Politics through Music \u2013 will be taught by the African American studies and music professor Daphne Brooks beginning in the upcoming spring semester. Brooks, who co-founded Yale\u2019s Black Sound &amp; the Archive Working Group, previously taught a class called Black Women in Popular Music Culture at Princeton, which like Yale, is an Ivy League institution. But it will be her first class focused solely on the pop superstar who \u2013 among other accolades \u2013 has won 32 Grammy awards and has attained a level of political influence few in the music industry have. Brooks\u2019s new college course offering is bound to become the latest to examine a pop culture icon\u2019s impact. Universities have also offered classes on Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and Harrison Ford. Brooks told the Guardian there had been \u201cwaves and waves of excitement \u2013 from undergraduates as well as graduate students\u201d about the class, as well as from \u201cfellow colleagues and staff\u201d. She said Yale required no convincing to green-light the class, adding: \u201cThis is the first opportunity I\u2019ve had to focus an entire lecture course on the truly astonishing and marked socio-political and intellectual shift in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s repertoire since her 2013 self-titled album. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to exploring her body of work and considering how, among other things, historical memory, Black feminist politics, Black liberation politics and philosophies course through the last decade of her performance repertoire as well as the ways that her unprecedented experimentations with the album form, itself, have provided her with the platform to mobilize these themes.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s direct involvement in politics is minimal. But she always attracts major news headlines when she does get involved. She sang at Barack Obama\u2019s presidential inaugurations in 2009 and 2013. More recently, she gave Kamala Harris\u2019s unsuccessful presidential campaign this year permission to use her song Freedom as its anthem. She also formally endorsed Harris and made an appearance at her rally in a packed stadium in her home town of Houston, Texas, where fans were hoping that she would perform, though she did not. \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 one of the top streamed artists of all time \u2013 said at the rally. \u201cI\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother \u2013 a mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in.\u201d Classes like the one Yale is offering on Beyonc\u00e9 often draw significant student interest. The Taylor Swift and her World class at Harvard enrolled 300 students when it was first offered earlier this year. Brook\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9 class will be offered by multiple departments, including those of African American studies, women\u2019s gender and sexuality studies and American studies and music.",

        "trailText": "Singer says America is on the \u2018brink of history\u2019 as Kamala Harris said Trump would seek to make state\u2019s abortion ban nationwide",
        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 lent her star power to Kamala Harris at a high-octane rally in Texas on Friday, declaring that the America was on the \u201cbrink of history\u201d as the vice-president warned the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban could become the law of the land if Donald Trump is elected. \u201cFor all the men and women in this room, and watching around the country, we need you,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told a roaring crowd of 30,000 people at the open-air Shell Energy stadium in her native Houston. With the presidential race effectively deadlocked, Harris detoured briefly from the seven battleground states to appear in deep-red Texas. Here in a place she called \u201cground zero for the fight for reproductive freedom\u201d, Harris sought to lay out the stakes in November for voters who have yet to make up their minds about the candidates \u2013 or whether to cast a ballot at all. \u201cLet us be clear: If Donald Trump wins again, he will ban abortion nationwide,\u201d Harris told the audience, her largest to date. She walked on to the stage, as she has ever since she became the presumptive nominee roughly 100 days ago, to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hard-charging anthem, Freedom. Harris has framed her campaign on the theme of freedom, painting Trump as a threat to hard-won progress advancing personal liberties and to American democracy itself. Earlier this week, Harris agreed that Trump was a \u201cfascist\u201d. The crowd that turned out for Harris on Friday night was exuberant. Thousands lined up for hours in the sticky Houston heat to attend. Rally-goers wore flashing wristbands in all different colors added to the concert-like atmosphere. A group of women in cowboy hats and boots danced and sang as a DJ spun pop ballads before the event began. But the message Harris came to deliver was sobering. In her remarks, she detailed the cascading effects of abortion bans like the one in Texas, which prohibits physicians from performing abortions after cardiac activity is detected, as early as six weeks. Doctors were being driven out of states, leaving women, particularly in the south, with fewer healthcare options. But it wasn\u2019t just Republican-led states at risk, she said, warning that a second Trump administration would seek to outlaw abortion in every state, even New York, Michigan and California, where it legal. \u201cAll that to say, elections matter,\u201d she said. Despite the speculation, the megastar did not perform, but she did offer her endorsement of Harris, a woman \u201cstanding in her power\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m here as a mother,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. A mother who cares deeply about the world my children, and all of our children, live in. A world where we have the freedom to control our bodies.\u201d In the final days before the election, the Harris campaign is tapping the star power of the party\u2019s most popular figures and celebrity supporters. On Friday night, Willie Nelson, the country music star who was introduced as a \u201cTexas voter\u201d, performed a handful of his best-known songs, including On the Road Again and actor Jessica Alba urged women to vote. Beyonc\u00e9 was joined by her mother, Tina Knowles, and her former bandmate Kelly Rowland, who gave a rousing call to action on Harris\u2019s behalf. \u201cWe are grabbing back the pen from those who are trying to write an American story that would deny the right for women to make our own decisions about our bodies,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cToday that means grabbing that pen and casting my vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d The night before, Harris held her first campaign event with Barack Obama. They were joined onstage in Atlanta by rocker Bruce Springsteen, who played a three-song set and branded Trump an \u201cAmerican tyrant.\u201d On Saturday, Harris will rally with Michelle Obama in Michigan. Trump was also in Texas on Friday, where he taped a lengthy podcast interview with Joe Rogan. And, at an earlier stop, he repeated his assertion that migration had turned the US into a \u201cgarbage can for the world\u201d. Before sitting for her own podcast interview with vulnerability researcher Bren\u00e9 Brown, Harris responded to Trump\u2019s remark, calling it \u201canother example of how he really belittles our country\u201d. Harris does not expect to win Texas. But Democrats here are suddenly hopeful after polls suggest an unexpectedly close senate race between the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, and the Democrat, Dallas-area congressman Colin Allred. Senate Democrats face a daunting map this cycle. With a loss in West Virginia all but certain, and Montana slipping away, their hopes of maintaining narrow-control of the chamber increasingly rest on an upset in the Lone Star state. In his remarks, Allred taunted his opponent for supporting Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which led to the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, and for fleeing to Canc\u00fan, Mexico, during a winter storm that devastated the state. \u201cEverything is bigger in Texas. But Ted Cruz is too small for Texas,\u201d Allred said, holding his hand low for emphasis. The emotional heart of the evening was the personal stories of Texas women who had nearly died from pregnancy-related complications because they did not receive proper care. Ondrea Cummings, a Texas woman who appeared in a new Harris campaign, became emotional as she shared her harrowing experience after a miscarriage at 16 weeks and needing an emergency abortion that she was denied under the state\u2019s law. A video played before her remarks showed her with a wound and scars that stretched down her body, from her breast to her pelvis, after a six-hour surgery in which she said doctors had to cut open her torso in order to save her life. \u201cTexas\u2019 abortion bans unleashed by Donald Trump almost cost me my life and have left me with physical and emotional scars,\u201d she said. Amanda and Josh Zurawski, residents of Austin, Texas, also shared their story. At 18 weeks pregnant with a girl she planned to name Willow, Amanda Zurawski began to suffer complications and needed an abortion. There was no chance the fetus would survive, but doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy until she eventually developed sepsis, days later. \u201cI was finally close enough to death to deserve healthcare in Texas,\u201d said Amanda Zurawski, who has been a powerful surrogate for Harris on the campaign trail. Todd Ivey, an OB-GYN in Houston, addressed the crowd surrounded by a team of doctors and medical professionals in white coats. He emphasized the challenges of administering care to patients under a law that threatens physicians with jail time for performing abortions. Since the Texas\u2019s abortion law took effect the state\u2019s infant mortality has risen. \u201cThese laws are designed to handcuff me \u2013 literally,\u201d he said, declaring: \u201cThere is no place for Donald Trump in my exam room.\u201d Among those in the crowd was Sara Gonzales, of Splendora, Texas, who rescheduled her work schedule so that she could drive straight to the stadium after finishing an early-morning shift at Starbucks. The 32-year-old said she considers herself an independent and in 2020, wrote in a candidate for president. But the political stakes changed, Gonzales said, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, and Texas enacted its near-total ban on abortion. She plans to vote for Harris in the 5 November election. \u201cBeing a woman in Texas right now, it\u2019s not OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have freedom over my own body.\u201d",

        "trailText": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris appear in Texas with just days to go until polls open in the 5 November 2024 presidential election",
        "bodyText": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump centred their attention on Texas on Friday, with both presidential candidates holding events there. In appearances on opposite sides of the staunchly Republican state, the nominees set out their contrasting visions for the country \u2013 with the content of their pitches underlining recent polling data which shows the gender gap among voters widening to historic levels. In Houston, Harris was joined by Beyonc\u00e9, with the Democratic candidate telling the Texas crowd that they were \u201cground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom\u201d. She went on to call out Texas for having one of the most restrictive bans in the country, adding \u201cnow one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban\u201d. Meanwhile, an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan in Austin created another opportunity for Trump to highlight the hyper-masculine tone that has defined much of his 2024 White House bid. A Trump victory could hinge on men turning out to vote for the Republican nominee, according to Politico, which highlighted Rogan\u2019s podcast as a good place to reach them. With an audience in the tens of millions, The Joe Rogan Experience has built a massive, mostly male, audience. Here\u2019s what else happened on Friday: Kamala Harris election news At the conclusion of her Houston rally, Harris called on voters to cast their ballots early. \u201cDo we trust women? Do we believe in reproductive freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America, and are we ready to fight for it?\u201d Harris said, before concluding by saying, \u201cWhen we fight, we win.\u201d In Houston, Beyonc\u00e9 was joined by her former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate, Kelly Rowland, in front of an audience of 30,000 people. \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity. I\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cImagine our daughters growing up seeing what\u2019s possible with no ceilings, no limitations.\u201d While Beyonc\u00e9 appealed to a younger crowd, 91-year-old Willie Nelson showed earlier in the event that he still has cachet in his native Texas. \u201cAre we ready to say Madam President?\u201d Nelson asked the crowd before launching into Mammas Don\u2019t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys, to which the audience sang along. Colin Allred, the Democratic congressman running to unseat Texas senator Ted Cruz, used the rally to denounce his opponent. \u201cI believe in a very different Texas than Ted Cruz does,\u201d Allred said. \u201cMy time in Congress, I\u2019ve been the exact opposite of Ted Cruz, because I never forgot where I came from, never forgot the folks who gave me a chance. He went on to lead the crowd in a chant of \u201cYou gotta lose your job.\u201d Tim Walz delivered a rousing pep talk in Scranton, Pennsylvania, telling voters the race was \u201cgoing to be tight\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the fourth quarter. We have got the best team on the field,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe have got to do this one inch at a time, one yard at a time, one door at a time, one call at a time, one dollar at a time, one vote at a time.\u201d Donald Trump election news Donald Trump ran hours late to a rally in Michigan, causing thousands of his supporters to leave while others huddled in cold weather to await the former president at an outdoor rally in the battleground state. The Republican presidential nominee was delayed by his interview with Rogan, which stretched to three hours. In Michigan, Trump said \u201cwe\u2019ve got a war going and she\u2019s out partying,\u201d a reference to Israel\u2019s attacks on Iran. Chinese government-linked hackers are believed to have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, as part of a larger breach of US telecommunications networks, according to a New York Times report. Investigators are working to determine what data, if any, was accessed by the \u201csophisticated\u201d hack, sources said. Elsewhere on the campaign trail There was uproar and outrage among the Washington Post\u2019s current and former staff and other notable figures in the world of American media after the newspaper\u2019s leaders on Friday chose to not endorse any candidate in the US presidential election. The newspaper\u2019s publisher, Will Lewis, announced on Friday that for the first time in over 30 years, the paper\u2019s editorial board would not be endorsing a candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election, nor in future presidential elections. The decision, according to some staffers and reporters, was allegedly made by the Post\u2019s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos. Russian actors were behind a widely circulated video falsely depicting mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania, US officials confirmed. The video had taken off on social media but was debunked within three hours by local election officials and law enforcement after members of the public reported it. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has called for the defence department to investigate a report that Elon Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Politico reports. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee, said \u201cElon Musk, who has billions in contracts that support some of our most sensitive military operations, reportedly has an open line to Putin.\u201d Musk\u2019s spacecraft company SpaceX has multiple contracts with the defence department and Nasa. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the billionaire has had previously unreported discussions with Putin since 2022. A fresh group of \u201clifelong Republican\u201d former aides to Donald Trump added their voices to the chorus of criticism of the Republican nominee, speaking out in support of John Kelly, who earlier this week called his old boss a fascist. \u201cThe revelations General Kelly brought forward are disturbing and shocking. But because we know Trump and have worked for and alongside him, we were sadly not surprised by what General Kelly had to say,\u201d a letter from more than a dozen staffers who worked in Trump\u2019s administration says.

        "bodyText": "The first single I bought When Doves Cry by Prince on seven-inch from a little shop called The Lighthouse in Anstruther. Being a small fishing village, we didn\u2019t have a record shop. We had a shop that sold many things, like a dusty cowboy town where you\u2019d buy your groceries, a gun and beer \u2013 but it sold lightbulbs, plugs and records. The first song I fell in love with When I started dating my husband [Editors singer Tom Smith], he would sing Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right by Bob Dylan as a vocal warmup in the sound check. I\u2019d get this kind of lovely private gig time and time again. Whenever I hear it, my heart bursts back to that first flurry of falling in love. The song that gets me up in the morning Tristesse by Zaho de Sagazan, the French singer-songwriter who opened the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics. I love the way she sings. Her pronunciation of her French is just: so clear, pristine and sexy, then this pounding crescendo rave comes, which is such a great awakening. The song I do at karaoke Crazy in Love. And I do both the Beyonc\u00e9 and the Jay-Z parts. I\u2019ll lick my finger and run it down my chest. In my eyes, I am in that video. The song I inexplicably know every lyric to Say No Go by De La Soul. I love that album, 3 Feet High and Rising. It\u2019s such a great mix of hip-hop, sampling and comedy. I went through three cassette versions when I wore it out listening to it in my little Mini Metro when I passed my test. The best song to play a party I still love to play Insomnia by Faithless when I\u2019m DJing. It\u2019s got such energy, it\u2019s like a tonic that lifts you. I love nothing better than watching thousands of people\u2019s eyes widen and their hands shoot up in the air. Or you can enjoy it on your own, dancing about like you\u2019re in the middle of a rave in the kitchen. The song that changed my life Blood by Editors. My friend Gemma said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come and see them,\u201d so I went to the Garage, and I saw them again in Kentish Town. We went out for a drink and Tom pretty much moved in the next day. That was 20 years ago. Now, we\u2019re two kids later. The song I stream the most My 11-year-old has control of my streaming services; it\u2019s ridiculous how many times American Idiot gets played. He\u2019s a drummer and he freaking loves Green Day. That\u2019s the funny thing about your kids having access to your streaming service. It changes your algorithms completely, which is actually quite fun because then you have no control over what\u2019s thrown your way. The song that makes me cry There\u2019s nothing better than a good cry, so I\u2019d put on On the Nature of Daylight by Max Richter if I need a good relief. It\u2019s just got a way of tapping into suppressed emotions. As my mum would say: it\u2019s better out than in. The song I\u2019d like played at my funeral Cornfield Chase by Hans Zimmer from Interstellar. I love the film, but I bloody love the soundtrack, and this is one of my favourite pieces of music ever. I love the church organ. It\u2019s such a gorgeous piece of music. Edith Bowman presents her new Radio 3 Unwind show Cinematic Soundtracks every, Monday to Saturday, from 5-6pm on BBC Sounds.",

        "bodyText": "Closing Summary This blog is closing now, thanks for following along. You can read our US elections coverage here. Here are the major developments from today: In Houston, Kamala Harris was joined onstage by superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9, congressman Colin Allred, musician Willie Nelson, actress Jessica Alba, several Texas-based OB-GYNs and families impacted by the state\u2019s abortion ban in what her campaign is calling their largest rally to date. Harris focused her remarks on the state\u2019s abortion ban, which sparked a slew of abortion restrictions nationwide, and was joined on stage by Amanda and Josh Zurawski, a Texas couple who sued the state after Amanda was unable to access treatment for a life-threatening pregnancy complication. Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Traverse City, Michigan was delayed several hours after the ex-president\u2019s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan lasted three hours. Trump Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on today. Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and JD Vance, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the sources, investigators are trying to determine what communication data may have been taken or observed. On Friday, Joe Biden formally apologized for the United States government\u2019s role in running at least 523 Indian boarding schools. His remarks were given at the Gila Crossing community school outside Phoenix, Arizona, and marked his first visit to Indian Country as president. The Washington Post declined to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s. Senior Democratic figure Susan Rice, who was US ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser under Barack Obama and then director of the US domestic policy council under Joe Biden, made a blistering post on X about the Washington Post. \u201cSo much for \u2018Democracy Dies in Darkness\u2019,\u201d she said, referring to the newspaper\u2019s slogan. Two Senate Democrats have written a letter urging the justice department to investigate, and if necessary prosecute, Elon Musk over his potentially illegal $1m giveaway for registered voters. And another top Democrat is calling for an investigation into Musk for the tech billionaire\u2019s ties to Russia. During his rally in Scranton tonight, Tim Walz took a moment to express his appreciation for Joe Biden, who was born in the Pennsylvania city and remains a popular figure there. \u201cThis country owes a huge debt to you and a huge debt to Joe Biden,\u201d Walz said. Harris raised $97m in the first half of October, compared with Trump\u2019s $16m, according to reports filed with the Federal Election commission. In an appearance on the Cats &amp; Cosby podcast, a conservative talk radio show, Donald Trump said special counsel Jack Smith should be deported. Trump made news yesterday when he said he would fire Smith, the justice department official who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents, \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of becoming president. Harris has concluded her rally in Houston, calling on voters to cast their ballots in the next 11 days. \u201cDo we trust women? Do we believe in reproductive freedom? Do we believe in the promise of America, and are we ready to fight for it?\u201d Harris said, before concluding, \u201cAnd when we fight, we win.\u201d \u201cWe know weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,\u201d Harris says, quoting Psalm 30:5 and encouraging voters to get out to the polls before 5 November. Speaking to Gen Z voters in the audience, Harris says that she \u201csees your power\u201d. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right that you may have fewer rights than your mother or your grandmother,\u201d Harris said, before asking the crowd: \u201cCan we applaud our leaders who are voting for the first time?\u201d Seeking to cast herself in contrast to Donald Trump, Harris said she will restore reproductive freedom if elected president. \u201cWhen Congress passes the bill to restore reproductive freedom, I will proudly sign it into law,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSince Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, from Kansas to California to Kentucky and Michigan, Montana, Vermont and Ohio, the people of America have voted for freedom.\u201d Harris is continuing, speaking about the stakes of the supreme court if Trump is re-elected. \u201cAnd now the attorney general of Texas is suing the United States government so that Texas prosecutors can get their hands on private medical records of women who leave the state to get care,\u201d Harris said. \u201cOn the one hand, Donald Trump won\u2019t let anyone see his medical records. I gave up mine. And on the other hand, they want to get their hands on your medical records. \u201cLet us be clear, if Donald Trump wins again, he will ban abortion nationwide,\u201d Harris said. \u201cNo one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban. \u201cIf Donald Trump is president again, he will likely get to appoint at least one justice\u201d to the Supreme court, Harris said. \u201cAt which point Donald Trump will have packed the court with five out of nine justices.\u201d Kamala Harris is continuing to excoriate Donald Trump, sharing the stories of women who\u2019ve been denied healthcare since Roe was overturned. \u201cTexas, what is happening across this state, in our country, is a health care crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect of it,\u201d Harris said. She went on to share the story of Ryan Hamilton, who found his wife alone and bleeding after being denied care for a miscarriage. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, men across America, this needs to be said, men across America do not want to see their sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken.\u201d Kamala Harris has just shared the story of Kate Cox, a Texas woman who was denied emergency abortion care by the Texas Supreme Court, and is introducing Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman. \u201cAmber Nicole Thurman, I promised her mother, I would speak her name, a vibrant 28 year old mother of a six year old son who died of preventive death because of Georgia\u2019s abortion ban,\u201d Harris said. Harris has continued, denouncing Republican leaders who have neglected maternal and infant healthcare while denying abortion care across the US. \u201cFor decades, these extremist leaders, who have neglected prenatal care, maternity care and postpartum care, and who now continuously failing support women and children, claim to care of women and children. I have a question for them, where you been?\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhere have you been when it comes to helping pregnant women and new mothers? Where have you been when it comes to affordable child care?\u201d \u201cThe hypocrisy abounds,\u201d she said, before showing a video combining testimony of families who\u2019ve suffered under abortion bans alongside Donald Trump saying he did \u201ca great thing\u201d by appointing the Supreme court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Speaking onstage at her rally in Houston, Kamala Harris is making a powerful call for reproductive rights. \u201cYou are ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s happening here in Texas, doctors and nurses could go to prison for life simply for providing reproductive care.\u201d \u201cTexas has a law now that offers a cash bounty for turning in someone who merely helps a friend or a family member get the care they need,\u201d Harris added. \u201cIn some counties in Texas, they have passed travel bans to prevent women from going to other states to receive care.\u201d \u201cWhen Donald Trump was president, he hand selected the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade, and as he intended, they did. And now more than 20 states have a Trump abortion ban.\u201d \u201cNow, one in three American women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply help to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has welcomed Kamala Harris on stage, with her song Freedom playing in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s time to sing a new song,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cOur generations of loved ones before us are whispering a prophecy, a quest, a calling, an anthem, our moment right now. It\u2019s time for America to sing a new song.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly Rowland are speaking onstage at the Harris rally in Houston. \u201cWe are grabbing back the pen to write a new American story, a story of community, of equality, strength, of kindness and of hope,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWhen I was a little girl and I pledged allegiance to the United States of America, that flag meant something to me, and today that means grabbing that pen and casting my vote as I already did two days ago, for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity. I\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said. \u201cImagine our daughters growing up seeing what\u2019s possible with no ceilings, no limitations.\u201d \u201cYour voice has power and magnitude. Your vote is one of the most valuable tools. And we need you. Your freedom is your God given right, your human right,\u201d she added. Tina Knowles, an American businesswoman, fashion designer and mother of Beyonc\u00e9, is speaking now at Harris\u2019 rally in Houston. \u201cI\u2019ve been so blessed to have many careers, many Black jobs,\u201d Knowles opened, referencing Donald Trump\u2019s statement that immigrants are going to take so-called \u201cBlack jobs\u201d from Black Americans. \u201cThe best job that I\u2019ve ever had is being a mother.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be here with two of my daughters,\u201d Knowles said, before welcoming her daughter Beyonc\u00e9 and good friend Kelly Rowland. After a long intermission, Ondrea Cummings has begun speaking at the Harris rally in Houston. Cummings, a resident of San Antonio, is featured in a new ad that the Harris campaign released earlier this week, telling her story of nearly dying after a pregnancy complication. \u201cIn the fall of 2022, after many prayers, my husband and I found out that we were expecting. Everything changed when my one evening far too early into my pregnancy, after going to the ER and my OB GYN, and learning that my pregnancy was not viable, I was given no options. Despite being at high risk for infection because of Texas extreme laws, I was told I had to wait, which I did in the hospital for days,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cMy baby girl, Emery J, was born five days after my water broke. She lived only for a few minutes, but I hold my baby close to my heart,\u201d she said, describing how she developed a severe infection that left her hospitalized for three weeks afterward. \u201cToday is the first time I\u2019m sharing my story. It\u2019s taken many months of physical and emotional healing to get where I am today,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cTexas abortion bans unleashed by Donald Trump almost cost me my life,\u201d she added before noting that Black and brown womens\u2019 pain is often ignored. The Harris campaign reports that 30,000 people are at her Houston rally tonight, the largest crowd to date for her campaign. Follow along here: Colin Allred, the Democratic congressman running to unseat Texas senator Ted Cruz, is speaking at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Texas, denouncing his opponent and recalling his experience in Congress on January 6. \u201cI believe in a very different Texas than Ted Cruz does,\u201d Allred said. \u201cMy time in Congress, I\u2019ve been the exact opposite of Ted Cruz, because I never forgot where I came from, never forgot the folks who gave me a chance. I\u2019ve been the most bipartisan Texan in Congress, because that\u2019s how you get things done.\u201d \u201cTed Cruz is too small for Texas,\u201d Allred said, recalling how Cruz took refuge in a supply closet during the January 6 attack on the Capitol while Allred prepared to defend his colleagues, using the strength he says he built as an NFL linebacker, and how Cruz fled the state during a deadly winter storm. He went on to lead the crowd in a chant of \u201cYou gotta lose your job.\u201d Amanda and Josh Zurawski, a Texas couple who sued the state after Amanda was unable to access treatment for a life-threatening pregnancy complication, are speaking now at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Houston. \u201cAfter 18 months of grueling fertility treatments in the spring of 2022 we were thrilled to find out that she was pregnant with our first baby, a girl. We were over the moon,\u201d Josh said. \u201cMy first trimester was smooth sailing, but suddenly at 18 weeks, I suffered complications we were, with 100% certainty going to lose our baby girl. We were devastated. What I needed at that point was an abortion so that I could safely and with dignity, deliver our daughter and begin the healing process,\u201d Amanda added. \u201cBut this was Post Roe Texas, the near total abortion ban had gone into effect just two days after Amanda\u2019s water broke, ending the pregnancy would have been illegal abortion under the Texas ban, our doctor risked losing her license and even face jail time,\u201d Josh continued. \u201cEventually, Amanda\u2019s temperature spiked. She was shaking and disoriented. We rushed to the emergency room, and by this time, Amanda had developed an infection, which had become septic.\u201d \u201cI was finally close enough to death to deserve health care in Texas,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cIt is unthinkable to me that anyone could cheer on the cruel abortion bans that nearly took Amanda\u2019s life, but that\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have done,\u201d Josh said. \u201cThe decision about if and when to start a family should be ours to make. Not Donald Trump\u2019s, not Ted Cruz\u2019s. That\u2019s why we need to elect vice president Harris, representative Colin Allred and Democrats up and down the ballot to restore our reproductive freedom.\u201d Lifelong Texan and beloved musician Willie Nelson is on stage at the rally performing Mammas Don\u2019t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys and On the Road Again. The 91-year-old Texan wore his signature braids and red bandana as he performed on stage with a band. Yesenia Gamez Gamboa, a Tucson-area immigration lawyer, is sharing her experience healing from an ectopic pregnancy and pursuing IVF in order to conceive a family with her husband. \u201cAccess to a safe and quick abortion was what saved my life and preserved my fertility and now those very same protections are gone,\u201d she said, on stage at Kamala Harris\u2019 Houston rally. \u201cI trust women to make decisions over their own bodies, and I trust Texas Women to tell men like Ted Cruz. JD Vance and Donald Trump that they are done, their turn is over.\u201d Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign is playing another ad between speakers at its Houston rally. This one features a woman who recalls being impregnated by her abusive stepfather at the age of 12. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. I was a child. I didn\u2019t know what it meant to be pregnant at all. But I had options,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause Donald Trump overturned Roe v Wade, girls and women all over the country have lost the right to choose, even for rape or incest. Donald Trump did this. He took away our freedom.\u201d Todd Ivey, a Houston-based OB-GYN, is speaking now at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Texas, and is joined on stage with several colleagues in their white coats. \u201cToday in Texas, because of Donald Trump, I could be thrown in prison for life for providing reproductive health care,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cAs a result, many of my patients with tragic pregnancy complications have been forced to flee up to get the health care that they need and that they deserve.\u201d \u201cNearly 7 in 10 OB-GYNs say that abortion bans have worsened their ability to manage pregnancy related emergencies, and here in Texas, three and four OBGYNs have said they simply can no longer practice evidence based medicine,\u201d he added. \u201cTens of thousands of Texas women traveled out of state for abortion care last year, leaving their jobs, leaving their homes and leaving their families just to get medical care.\u201d \u201cI was shocked when Roe was overturned, but I\u2019ve never been more shocked to hear Donald Trump continue to brag about them,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cSo let me be clear about one thing, there is no place for Donald Trump in my exam room.\u201d Between speakers at Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Houston, the campaign briefly displayed an ad featuring the family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia woman who died because of the state\u2019s abortion ban. \u201cThis is the result of what happens when you try to control a woman\u2019s body. My daughter is gone because of what Donald Trump did. She would be here had they helped her,\u201d Thurman\u2019s mother, Shanette Williams, said in the video. Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Houston has gotten under way this evening, with actor Jessica Alba kicking off the event. \u201cIt was here in Texas that I learned the importance of looking out for your neighbors, lending a hand without hesitation and treating people the way you would want to be treated,\u201d Alba said, noting that she spent a portion of her childhood living in Del Rio, Texas. \u201cAs a woman, I know we need a leader like Kamala Harris who is dedicated to protecting reproductive freedom,\u201d she added, also noting her support for Harris\u2019s proposed child tax credit. \u201cSo let\u2019s hear it Houston, We are not going back,\u201d Alba concluded. Leonard Sanchez is attending the Harris rally with other members of his Local UFCW455, which represents grocery and retail workers in southern Texas and Louisiana. Being a long-time Democrat in a perennially red state can be \u201crough,\u201d he conceded. But he hopes Harris\u2019s star-studded event in the final stretch of the campaign jolt apathetic voters in the state, who feel their vote matters. But he said so much is on the line, especially in Texas, which has a near-total ban on abortion. While Sanchez is supportive of Harris, he also fears a return of \u201cthe other guy\u201d to the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s too anti-immigrant,\u201d he said, adding that Trump was not a real ally of labor. Sanchez said he is baffled by union members who are abandoning Democrats for Republicans, especially in a right-to-work state like Texas. He is hopeful Harris will take on big corporations and fight for better wages, but progress will also depend on changing the state\u2019s politics. \u201cEvery year we get a little bit closer and closer,\u201d Sanchez said. Among the crowd at the Harris rally in Houston, many said they waited for hours to get in, as temperatures climbed to 90F, just shy of a record for late October. Sara Gonzales, 32, of Splendora, Texas, rearranged her work schedule and drove to the stadium as soon as she finished her early-morning shift at Starbucks. Gonzales said she was an independent and and wrote-in a candidate for president in 2020. But the political stakes changed when the Supreme Court overturned Roe, and Texas enacted a near-total ban on abortion. \u201cBeing a woman in Texas right now, it\u2019s not ok. I should have freedom over my own body,\u201d she said. She views Harris as a protector of hard-fought \u201cfreedoms\u201d from abortion access to LGBTQ+ rights. Seated in the front row behind the stage, Tiffany Hiza, 48, and her mother Joyce Hiza, 80, wore green shirts touting their Jamaican ancestry, which they\u2019re proud to share with Harris. Being a Democrat in Texas can feel like \u201cswimming against the tide,\u201d Tiffany Hiza said. She and her mother voted on the first day of early voting this week for Harris, a poignant moment for her mother, who had come to fear she might never see a woman president after Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. In the final stretch, they\u2019ve tuned out the polls and the analysis. Both said they feel sanguine about Harris\u2019s chances. Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Traverse City, Michigan \u2013 originally scheduled for 7:30pm ET \u2013 has been postponed several hours following the ex-president\u2019s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung posted on X that the former president\u2019s interview lasted three hours, delaying his departure from Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re coming now, Michigan!\u201d Cheung wrote. He posted the message at 7:19 pm ET. The Upper Michigan Source reported that Trump is now expected to arrive in the state around 10:30pm ET. During his rally in Scranton tonight, Tim Walz took a moment to express his appreciation for Joe Biden, who was born in the Pennsylvania city and remains a popular figure there. \u201cThis country owes a huge debt to you and a huge debt to Joe Biden,\u201d Walz said. \u201c[Presidents] have always put this country above themselves, no matter the cost to their personal ambitions or what happened to them. Joe Biden has secured his place in history by upholding that tradition.\u201d The Scranton crowd erupted into cheers of \u201cJoe!\u201d as Walz spoke. Michael McNulty, a 47-year-old voter from Scranton, lives down the street from Biden\u2019s childhood home and expressed gratitude for the president but said he felt invigorated by the Harris-Walz ticket. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real sense of optimism and hope here. It\u2019s not just against Trump,\u201d McNulty, wearing a Harris-Walz camo hat, said after the Scranton rally. \u201cThey\u2019re sharing a vision for the future of the country that is one I want to live in. It\u2019s one that I want to raise my children in and that I\u2019m really proud to go out and contribute to make happen.\u201d Biden won Pennsylvania by 1.2 points in 2020, four years after Trump carried the state by 0.7 points. Although polls show a tied race, McNulty is confident that Harris will win the Keystone State this time around. \u201cWe\u2019re going to push this over the finish line here for the Harris-Walz ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cPA is going to deliver, and we\u2019re going to have Madame President.\u201d Thousands of fans waited for hours to attend Kamala Harris\u2019s event in Houston. Inside Shell Energy stadium, the crowd buzzed in anticipation of a performance by Beyonc\u00e9 in her native Houston. Lots of cowboy boots and cowboy hats. Some wore shirts that said \u201cMy president is a Black Woman\u201d. One man wore a sequined white blazer over a \u201ccomma la\u201d T-shirt. It\u2019s been decades since a Democratic presidential nominee stopped in the Lone Star state this close to Election Day and the Democrats here are ecstatic to be on the receiving end of some political love. The DJ just encouraged the crowd to let loose. \u201cIt\u2019s your American right,\u201d he said. The fifth circuit court of appeals ruled today that Mississippi violated federal law by counting mail ballots that are postmarked by election day, but arrive after that. The ruling, which was issued by a panel of three judges, does not require the state to make any changes before the election. The court\u2019s decision is a victory for the Republican National Committee, which brought the lawsuit, and a loss for Democrats and voting rights advocates, who worry the case will impact other states. Although the court\u2019s ruling is only binding in three states under the fifth circuit\u2019s jurisdiction (and not in effect for the current election), Democrats fear the decision could impact the outcome of elections in other states that allow ballots to be counted after election day \u2013 such as Nevada, Ohio, Virginia and Maryland \u2013 especially if the election is contested. Eight Washington Post columnists have issued a response to their paper\u2019s decision not to endorse a presidential candidate. \u201cAn independent newspaper might someday choose to back away from making presidential endorsements. But this isn\u2019t the right moment, when one candidate is advocating positions that directly threaten freedom of the press and the values of the Constitution,\u201d they write. The letter\u2019s signatories include Perry Bacon Jr, EJ Dionne Jr, David Ignatius, Ruth Marcus, Dana Milbank, Eugene Robinson, Jennifer Rubin and Karen Tumulty. A San Antonio election clerk was assaulted at a polling site yesterday \u2013 in what is believed to be the first instance of violence against an election worker this fall, The Texas Tribune reports. The suspect has been arrested on suspicion of injury to an elderly person, a felony. According to a Bexar County sheriff\u2019s report, the suspect, 63-year-old Jesse Lutzenberger, entered the polling location wearing a Make America Great Again hat. Displaying political slogans in polling sites is considered electioneering. The poll worker asked Lutzenberger to remove his hat and Lutzenberger proceeded to vote, but put the hat back on after. As the poll worker escorted Lutzenberger out of the building (after he cast his ballot), Sheriff Javier Salazar said a surveillance video showed Lutzenberger throw \u201cseveral punches right at the face of the victim.\u201d The poll worker received emergency medical treatment and Lutzenberger was booked into jail before being released on a $30,000 bond today. \u201cThis has been an especially contentious elections cycle,\u201d Salazar said at a Friday briefing. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several incidents where people show up wearing inappropriate clothing,\u201d that qualifies as electioneering. Tim Walz is currently campaigning in Joe Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The vice presidential nominee has praised Biden, saying \u201cThis country owes a huge debt to you and a huge debt to Joe Biden.\u201d Current Guardian polling shows Harris leading Trump by less than a point in the crucial swing state. Meanwhile, former president Barack Obama is in North Carolina campaigning for Kamala Harris. The Democratic Party has not won the swing state since 2008, when Obama was elected president. Our polling shows Harris trailing Trump by two points in the Tar Heel state. Another top Democrat is calling for an investigation into Elon Musk \u2013 this time for the tech billionaire\u2019s ties to Russia. Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, has called for the defense department to investigate a report that Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Politico reports. \u201cWe should investigate what Elon Musk is up to to make sure that it is not to the detriment of the national security of the United States,\u201d Smith said. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee, echoed Smith. \u201cElon Musk\u2014who has billions in contracts that support some of our most sensitive military operations\u2014reportedly has an open line to Putin,\u201d Shaheen said. Musk\u2019s spacecraft company SpaceX has multiple contracts with the defense department and NASA. According to a Wall Street Journal report published yesterday, the billionaire has had previously unreported discussions with Putin since 2022. Musk has been one of Donald Trump\u2019s greatest supporters this election cycle, donating $118m to his pro-Trump super Pac. Trumphas long been a vocal admirer of Putin\u2019s. After concluding his remarks in Austin this afternoon, Donald Trump spoke with executives from Blue Origin, the aerospace company owned by Jeff Bezos. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, also owns the Washington Post, which announced today that it wouldn\u2019t endorse a candidate for president. The Washington Post Guild, the union that represents many of the paper\u2019s staffers, said that according to the paper\u2019s reporters and Guild members, the endorsement for Harris was already drafted and the decision not to publish was made by Bezos himself. According to the Associated Press, Trump spoke briefly with Blue Origin\u2019s CEO, David Limp, and vice-president of government relations, Megan Mitchell, as he left a hangar where he spoke to supporters and journalists at the Austin airport. Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Anna Betts: Although Donald Trump refused to appear in a CNN townhall alongside Kamala Harrris this week, his running mate JD Vance will appear on the network this weekend. The vice presidential nominee will appear on CNN\u2019s State of the Union with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, alongside former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney, a longtime Republican who has endorsed Harris. Kamala Harris is expected to discuss the \u201cfundamental fight for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body\u201d at her Houston rally this evening. She\u2019ll appear alongside families that have been affected by abortion bans like Texas\u2019 \u2013 including Amanda and Josh Zurawski, a Texas couple who sued the state after Amanda was unable to access treatment for a life-threatening pregnancy complication, and Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia mother who died from an infection she feared seeking treatment for under the state\u2019s restrictive laws. \u201cSadly, the elected leaders of Texas, a lot of them, have made Texas ground zero in this fundamental fight for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body,\u201d Harris told reporters earlier today. \u201cThis is not just some theoretical concept. Real harm has occurred in our country, a real suffering has occurred. People have died.\u201d At a rally in Austin earlier today, Donald Trump said Harris was only campaigning in Texas in order to \u201crub shoulders with woke celebrities.\u201d Excerpts of Harris\u2019 prepared remarks show that the vice-president also intends to criticize Texas attorney general Ken Paxton (who sued the federal government \u201cso that Texas prosecutors can get their hands on the private medical records of women who leave the state to get care\u201d) and Trump (\u201cDonald Trump won\u2019t let anyone see his medical records. But these guys want to get their hands on yours?\u201d). Harris is also expected to argue that no state will be safe if Trump is re-elected and imposes a nationwide abortion ban \u2013 a policy Trump has fluctuated on despite nominating three of the conservative supreme court justices who ruled to overturn Roe v Wade. \u201cWhat happens in this election will determine the future of reproductive freedom for generations to come,\u201d Harris is expected to say. Two Senate Democrats have written a letter urging the justice department to investigate, and if necessary prosecute, Elon Musk over his potentially illegal $1m giveaway for registered voters. On Wednesday, the justice department sent a letter to Musk\u2019s America Super Pac warning that a $1m-a-day sweepstake the billionaire and Tesla CEO began last week may violate federal elections law. Despite the warning, Musk has continued the giveaway, naming two winners yesterday. In their letter to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, Vermont senator Peter Welch and Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal urge that the justice department to hold Musk accountable: \u201cPermitting this scheme to proceed without consequences makes a mockery of democracy and the law,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter first obtained by CNN. \u201cWe urge you to investigate whether Elon Musk\u2019s cash prizes are prohibited payments for voter registration and take appropriate enforcement action, including prosecution, if his actions prove to be illegal.\u201d Musk, who has endorsed Trump, has donated more than $118m to his pro-Trump political action committee and has recently begun campaigning for the ex-president in person. Kamala Harris\u2019s rally this evening with superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9 will be far from her last appearance alongside a celebrity musician. On Monday, Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, will campaign in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers. Then, on Wednesday, Harris will rally voters at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, alongside performances by Mumford &amp; Sons, two members of the band the National, Gracie Abrams and Remi Wolf. The performances come in the final days of a high-stakes election season, as both Democrats and Republicans urge voters to get out to the polls. In an appearance on the Cats &amp; Cosby podcast, a conservative talk radio show, Donald Trump said special counsel Jack Smith should be deported. Trump made news yesterday when he said he would fire Smith, the justice department official who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents, \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of becoming president. The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell has more: Thirteen \u201clifelong Republican\u201d former Trump administration staffers released a letter today echoing former Trump chief of staff John Kelly\u2019s warnings about the ex-president\u2019s authoritarian tendencies. Here\u2019s Joanna Walters with more: A fresh group of \u201clifelong Republican\u201d former aides to Donald Trump added their voices on Friday to the chorus of criticism of the Republican nominee\u2019s character and fitness for the White House, speaking out in support of John Kelly, who earlier this week called his old boss a fascist. \u201cThe revelations General Kelly brought forward are disturbing and shocking. But because we know Trump and have worked for and alongside him, we were sadly not surprised by what General Kelly had to say,\u201d a letter from more than a dozen staffers who worked in Trump\u2019s administration says, as first reported by Politico. Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and JD Vance, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the sources, investigators are trying to determine what communication data may have been taken or observed. On Friday, Joe Biden formally apologized for the United States government\u2019s role in running at least 523 Indian boarding schools. His remarks were given at the Gila Crossing community school outside Phoenix, Arizona, and marked his first visit to Indian Country as president. The new publisher of the Washington Post, controversial British journalist Will Lewis, squashed the paper\u2019s plans to endorse Kamala Harris for the White House in this election, according to a report. The Columbia Journalism Review has just published an article saying that senior figures at the Post had been preparing to publish the announcement that the Post was endorsing Harris, the Democratic nominee for president \u2013 but there were delays. Senior Democratic figure Susan Rice, who was US ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser under Barack Obama and then director of the US domestic policy council under Joe Biden, has made a blistering post on X about the Washington Post. \u201cSo much for \u2018Democracy Dies in Darkness\u2019,\u201d she said, referring to the newspaper\u2019s slogan. Joe Biden has formally apologized for the US government\u2019s role in running more than 500 Indian boarding schools. The Guardian\u2019s Adria R Walker reports: On Friday, Joe Biden formally apologized for the United States government\u2019s role in running at least 523 Indian boarding schools. His remarks were given at the Gila Crossing community school outside Phoenix, Arizona, and marked his first visit to Indian Country as president. \u201cAfter 150 years, the United States government eventually stopped the program,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut the federal government has never, never formally apologized for what happened \u2013 until today. I formally apologize, as president of the United States of America, for what we did. I formally apologize. That\u2019s long overdue.\u201d \u201cFederal Indian boarding school policy, the pain it has caused, will always be a significant mark of shame, a blot on American history,\u201d he said. \u201cFor too long, this all happened with virtually no public attention.\u201d For the full story, click here: Chinese hackers have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and JD Vance, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the sources, investigators are trying to determine what communication data may have been taken or observed. They added that Trump\u2019s and Vance\u2019s teams have been alerted this week and that the two men were \u201camong a number of people inside and outside the government whose phone numbers had been targeted through the infiltration of Verizon phone systems\u201d, the New York Times reports. It added that Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung did not directly address whether the phones used by Trump and Vance have been targeted. The outlet did however report that Cheung blamed the Biden-Harris administration for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign. In August, the FBI said that Iranian hackers targeted the Trump campaign and sent documents to the Biden campaign. Iran\u2019s efforts include \u201cthefts and disclosures\u201d and \u201care intended to influence the US election process\u201d, a joint statement by the FBI, the office of the director of national intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said at the time. Joining Donald Trump on stage was Alexis Nungaray, the mother of 12-year old Jocelyn, who was murdered earlier this summer. The people accused of killing Jocelyn are Franklin Pena and Johan Jose Martinez Rangel, two undocumented men from Venezuela. Addressing the crowd, Nungaray said: She was just being a child and due to the Biden-Harris policies we have here are why she\u2019s not here any more. She was taken from her vulnerability and they made her a target, and ran with that and now I will for ever be a grieving mother and my son will for ever be a grieving brother who will no longer get to grow up with his sister. Kamala Harris has never reached out to me, just even as a human to give her condolences as a humane person running this country. I think it\u2019s very sad that she can\u2019t even just give me an open apology, sincere apology. She\u2019s attempted to apologize to me just days before this election. I find it very inconvenient and convenient for her. I appreciate everything Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz have done for me. They\u2019ve been a tremendous amount of help for me and my family during this incredibly hard, hard journey. Donald Trump has taken the stage at a campaign rally in Austin, Texas. Addressing the latest decision from a federal judge that Virginia must restore voter eligibility to more than 1,600 people after their eligibility was illegally removed, Trump said: The outrageous decision goes against the very bedrock of our democracy. Trump, who has also falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen from him, called the decision \u201cblatantly non-American, it\u2019s election interference\u201d, and went on to baselessly accuse Kamala Harris of being \u201cbehind it\u201d. Kamala Harris is talking to reporters in Houston, in one of her new, impromptu quick comments on camera at short notice and willingness to take questions on the hop. She has just criticized Donald Trump for his comments on the campaign trail last night when he called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s just another example of how he really belittles our country,\u201d Harris said. The Democratic nominee for president is standing against a backdrop of American flags, shortly after arriving in Houston, Texas, which, despite being a strongly Republican-voting state, is a place her campaign thinks is a powerful springboard for a national message. Harris is appearing with Beyonc\u00e9 and Willy Nelson tonight. Harris continued on about Trump, the Republican nominee, about him enjoying a bully pulpit. \u201cAnd this is how he uses it? To tell the rest of the world that the United States is trash?\u201d she said. She said it was not how the president of the United States should behave. Asked whether she has voted yet, she said no, not yet. Asked if she could get pro-choice legislation through Congress to restore the rights of Roe v Wade \u2013 taken away by a US supreme court stacked by Trump to the right \u2013 she pointed out, revealingly, that if Democratic candidate Colin Allred can unseat GOP Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, it will boost her party\u2019s hopes of keeping control of the US Senate, which is crucial to pass legislation. The new publisher of the Washington Post, controversial British journalist Will Lewis, squashed the paper\u2019s plans to endorse Kamala Harris for the White House in this election, according to a report. The Columbia Journalism Review has just published an article saying that senior figures at the Post, including in the opinion section and on the board, had been preparing to publish the announcement that the Post was endorsing Harris, the Democratic nominee for president \u2013 but there were delays. Then earlier today, the publication announced it would not endorse either Harris or her Republican rival Donald Trump \u2013 and that the plan to back Harris had been reversed by Lewis. It quoted a democracy expert, Ian Bassin, from a previous CJR article calling the decision by the Post \u2013 and also this week by the Los Angeles Times, which is also owned by a billionaire \u2013 not to endorse \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d in trying to appease Donald Trump in case he wins. Trump has called the mainstream media \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d. Senior Democratic figure Susan Rice, who was US ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser under Barack Obama and then director of the US domestic policy council under Joe Biden, has made a blistering post on X about the Washington Post. \u201cSo much for \u2018Democracy Dies in Darkness\u2019,\u201d she said, referring to the newspaper\u2019s slogan. She continued: \u201cThis is the most hypocritical, chicken shit move from a publication that is supposed to hold people in power to account.\u201d There is welling disquiet over the Washington Post\u2019s announcement that it will decline to endorse either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in this election. A former long-serving senior editor from the paper called it \u201cappalling\u201d, especially \u201cgiven the choice this year\u201d. Robert McCartney has previously speculated that the Post would endorse Harris and also had heard on the grapevine that they would dodge. Here\u2019s his reaction on X now: McCartney had posted yesterday: \u201cThere\u2019s speculation in newsroom that owner Jeff Bezos may want to avoid risk of endangering Amazon\u2019s government contracts if Trump wins.\u201d Publisher Will Lewis was a controversial choice by Bezos at the Post, which the Amazon mogul owns. A British police special enquiry team is examining allegations that Lewis presided over the deliberate destruction of emails at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK newspaper business when he worked for the company 13 years ago. Sally Buzbee, the editor who took over from Marty Baron, was forced out last year in a move instigated by Lewis, who wanted to replace her with fellow Brit Robert Winnett, but he shortly after backed out amid uproar at the Post. Marty Baron, the distinguished former editor of the Washington Post, has excoriated his old employer\u2019s decision not to endorse either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in next month\u2019s presidential election. Baron, who was editor of the Boston Globe before he moved to the capital to run the Post in 2013 \u2013 both of which publications have won Pulitzer prizes under his leadership \u2013 has called the Post\u2019s move to avoid picking a favored nominee for the White House \u201ccowardice\u201d. He posted on X that it represented: \u201cDisturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\u201d Baron retired from the Washington Post in 2021. You can read the Guardian\u2019s profile of him then, here. As Tim Walz prepares to take the stage in Philadephia for a campaign rally event, here\u2019s a look at where things stand in the world of US politics: For the first time since the 1980s, the Washington Post has said it will not endorse any US presidential candidate this year nor in any future presidential elections. A note from publisher Will Lewis that was posted on X on Friday said: \u201cWe recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don\u2019t see it that way.\u201d Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are tied at 48%, according to a new poll by the New York Times and Siena College. Published on Friday, the poll also revealed that 31% of registered voters view Trump as very favorable while 29% view Harris as very favorable. More young Americans favor Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, according to a new Harvard Youth Poll published today by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School. The poll, which surveyed 2,001 voters under the age of 30 between 3 and 14 October, found that Harris leads Trump by 20 points among registered voters under 30 and by 28 points among likely voters. Joe Biden has issued a statement ahead of his presidential apology for the federal Indian boarding school era, calling it \u201cone of the darkest chapters of American history\u201d. In his statement, Biden said: \u201cThe Federal Indian Boarding School Era is one of the darkest chapters of American history. The trauma experienced in those institutions haunts our conscience to this very day.\u201d Jill Biden is set to campaign alongside Gwen Walz in Michigan and Wisconsin next week. In a press release issued on Friday, the Harris-Walz campaign said that the two educators will campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, marking the first time they campaign together. With just a few days away from the election, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign continues to raise significantly more funds than Donald Trump\u2019s. In the first half of October, Harris\u2019s campaign reported $97m raised, according to reports filed on Thursday with the Federal Election Commission, Politico reports. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign raised $16m during this time period. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are taking a detour from barnstorming the battleground states that will decide November\u2019s election with Friday stops in Texas, a conservative state that was the first to implement a near-total abortion ban. Superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9 is expected to join Harris at her Houston stop and perform, two sources told Reuters. Harris has made Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song Freedom her campaign anthem. For the first time since the 1980s, the Washington Post has said it will not endorse any US presidential candidate this year nor in any future presidential elections. A note from publisher Will Lewis that was posted on X on Friday said: We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility. That is inevitable. We don\u2019t see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects. We also see it as a statement in support of our readers\u2019 ability to make up their own minds on this, the most consequential of American decisions \u2013 whom to vote for as the next president. Our job at The Washington Post is to provide through the newsroom non-partisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds. Most of all, our job as the newspaper of the capital city of the most important country in the world is to be independent. And that is what we are and will be. Kamala Harris has released the following statement to mark one year since the Lewiston shootings in Maine when 18 people were killed and another 13 were injured by a gunman who stormed a bowling alley and a restaurant: One year ago, an act of senseless violence carried out with a weapon of war took the lives of 18 loved ones and injured 13 others in Lewiston, Maine. Doug and I join all Mainers in remembering those who lost their lives on that fall night, standing with their families, and thinking of the survivors of this horrific mass shooting. In the 12 months since this tragedy took place at a local restaurant and a bowling alley, the Lewiston community has shown incredible unity, resilience and strength. They have responded by reminding the nation of the unacceptable fact that far too many families have experienced the tremendous pain and trauma caused by the epidemic of gun violence. This is exactly why I have worked to take action to address this issue with the urgency it demands and keep our loved ones safe \u2026 I continue to call on Congress to pass universal background checks, red flag and safe storage laws, a ban on bump stocks, and a renewal of the assault weapons ban. In a new tweet on Friday, Kamala Harris warned of Donald Trump\u2019s threats of using the justice department against his enemies, saying: Donald Trump has been very clear that he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. You know who does that? Dictators do that. More young Americans favor Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, according to a new Harvard Youth Poll published today by the Institute of Politics (IOP) at Harvard Kennedy School. The poll, which surveyed 2,001 voters under the age of 30 between 3 and 14 October, found that Harris leads Trump by 20 points among registered voters under 30 and by 28 points among likely voters. In the seven key swing states, Harris\u2019s lead narrows to 9 points among registered voters under 30. Interestingly, the survey found that peer influence might play a crucial role in voter turnout for those under 30. When young Americans believe their friends will vote, 79% say they plan to vote as well, per the survey, compared with just 35% for those who think peers will not participate. \u201cThe social dynamic of youth voting has never been more clear: when young Americans believe their friends will vote, they\u2019re nearly two and a half times more likely to cast a ballot themselves,\u201d John Della Volpe, the polling director of the Institute of Politics, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s peer influence, not just politics, that could determine youth turnout this year \u2013 and ultimately who becomes the next president.\u201d Here is the live stream of Tim Walz\u2019s campaign event in Philadelphia: Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates. Tim Walz is scheduled to attend a campaign rally in Philadephia later this morning. The vice-presidential candidate\u2019s visit to the City of Brotherly Love comes as part of his campaign stops across Pennsylvania, which will also include Allentown and Scranton. Ahead of his Philadelphia rally, Walz spoke to Philadephia-based radio station WHYY on which he said: Donald Trump\u2019s tendencies now are fascist tendencies, he has a long history of his racial comments. His running mate, JD Vance, said voters just don\u2019t like the racist part of Donald Trump. Walz\u2019s comments about Trump follow a slew of similar comments made by Democrats and former Trump allies in recent days who have likened the former president to a fascist. The ongoing elections in Ohio could decide control of the US Senate. Stephen Starr reports for the Guardian: When the Democrat Sherrod Brown was first elected to the US Senate in 2006, Ohio, with its large urban populations and manufacturing industries, was fairly reliable territory for Democrats. Barack Obama claimed the state in 2008 and 2012 on his way to the White House. Democrats boasted strong representation in Ohio\u2019s politics. Analysts zealously watched its voting patterns, such was its prominence as a bellwether state. In the years since, the state has become older, whiter and more conservative. Manufacturing has shrunk and population has stagnated. Brown is now the only Democrat holding a statewide seat in Ohio. And he is weeks out from a crucial Senate election against former luxury car dealer Bernie Moreno, a contest that could reshape US politics for years to come, For one, keeping Brown\u2019s seat is crucial if Democrats hope to maintain their control of the US Senate. For the full story, click here: Joe Biden has issued a statement ahead of his presidential apology for the federal Indian boarding school era, calling it \u201cone of the darkest chapters of American history\u201d. In his statement, Biden said: The Federal Indian Boarding School Era is one of the darkest chapters of American history. The trauma experienced in those institutions haunts our conscience to this very day. Today, I\u2019m in Arizona to issue a long overdue presidential apology for this era \u2013 and speak to how my Administration has worked to invest in Indian Country and our relationships with Tribal Nations, advance Tribal sovereignty and self-determination, respect Native cultures, and protect Indigenous sacred sites. On my watch, we\u2019ll remain committed to ushering in a new era between our government and nation-to-nation relationships \u2013 one that is grounded in dignity and respect. We must remember our full history, even when it\u2019s painful. That\u2019s what great nations do. And we are a great nation. Jill Biden is set to campaign alongside Gwen Walz in Michigan and Wisconsin next week. In a press release issued on Friday, the Harris-Walz campaign said that the two educators will campaign in Michigan and Wisconsin, marking the first time they campaign together. In Bay City, Michigan, they will attend a Women for Harris-Walz event which will focus on reproductive freedoms. In Traverse City, Michigan, the two women will join Harris-Walz campaign supporters for a volunteer mobilization event. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, they will attend an Educators for Harris-Walz event. Former model Stacey Williams says Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein \u2018coordinated\u2019 the groping incident at Trump Towers in 1993. The Guardian\u2019s Jessica Glenza reports: Former model Stacey Williams said she thought Donald Trump groped her to show off to her then boyfriend, the late financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein, when the couple dropped by to visit him in Trump Tower in New York in 1993. In her first detailed, on-camera interview since discussing assault allegations with the Guardian, Williams late on Thursday told CNN that she recalled the former president and Epstein smiled at each other as the property mogul was feeling her up, which gave her the impression the entire incident was a \u201ccoordinated\u201d game between the two men. Her account comes just weeks before the presidential election, in which Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris are essentially tied, according to polls. Trump has denied Williams\u2019s accounts. \u201cThe second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him and his hands were just on me and didn\u2019t come off,\u201d Williams told CNN, echoing her account to the Guardian. \u201cThen the hands started moving on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt, back up, sort of \u2013 they were just on me the whole time, and I froze,\u201d she said. For the full story, click here: With just a few days away from election day, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign continues to raise significantly more funds than Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. In the first half of October, Harris\u2019s campaign reported $97m raised, according to reports filed on Thursday with the Federal Election Commission, Politico reports. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign raised $16m during this time period. The outlet reports: The picture looked slightly better for Trump when looking at his overall political operation, including money raised through joint fundraising committees, but Harris still maintained a significant advantage, with $176 million raised across her network compared to $97 million for Trump when including his affiliated fundraising groups.\u201d It also added that in the first 16 days of October, Harris\u2019s campaign outspent Trump\u2019s campaign significantly \u2013 $166m compared with $99m. For both candidates, paid media was the largest category, with Harris\u2019s campaign spending $127m and Trump\u2019s campaign spending $88m. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are tied at 48%, according to a new poll by the New York Times and Siena College. Published on Friday, the poll, the poll also revealed that 31% of registered voters view Trump as very favorable while 29% view Harris as very favorable. Ms Harris\u2019s position, if anything, may have declined among likely voters since the last Times/Siena College poll, taken in early October. At the time, she had a slight lead over Mr Trump, 49 percent to 46 percent. The change is within the margin of error, but The Times\u2019s national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks as well, suggesting at the very least that this contest has drawn even closer. In response to which candidate would do a better job of handling the issue voters regard as most important, 46% said Harris while 49% said Trump. Additionally, 45% said they believe Harris would do a better job on the economy, compared to 52% who indicated their preference for Trump. On abortion, 55% indicated Harris as the candidate who would do a better job to address the issue, compared to 40% who chose Trump. On immigration, 43% chose Harris while 54% chose Trump. Speaking on CNN in response to what she thinks Kamala Harris needs to do to avoid repeating the 2016 loss to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton said: \u201cI don\u2019t think she has Jim Comey in the wings waiting to kneecap her so that\u2019s good.\u201d Clinton made the comment in reference to then-FBI director who reopened the investigation into her private email server days before the 2016 election. Clinton went on to add: \u201cI think she is doing what she needs to do, and\u2026a number of the voters who were at [the CNN] town hall have said she convinced them, that she had shown the kind of empathy and concern about their problems, that she had come forward with her ideas, her suggested policies. So, I think she\u2019s doing what she needs to do.\u201d Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are taking a detour from barnstorming the battleground states that will decide November\u2019s election with Friday stops in Texas, a conservative state that was the first to implement a near-total abortion ban. Superstar singer Beyonc\u00e9 is expected to join Harris at her Houston stop and perform, two sources told Reuters. Harris has made Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cFreedom\u201d her campaign anthem. Texas hasn\u2019t backed a Democratic president since 1976, and Republican Trump is almost certain to win the state\u2019s 40 electoral college votes, Reuters reported. But Democrats are betting it will provide a powerful backdrop for vice-president Harris to talk about abortion rights in the final days before the election. Harris will speak about the danger former president Trump and Republicans could present to abortion rights across the country if he\u2019s elected, a campaign source said, and be joined by women who have suffered after Texas\u2019 anti-abortion regulations were passed and their family members. Texas implemented a first-of-its kind law in September 2021 that banned abortion after six weeks and allowed anyone to sue abortion patients in violation and those who assisted them. A former model has said Donald Trump and the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein were \u201clooking at each other and smiling\u201d while the former president groped her body. Stacey Williams accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993, in what she believed was a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. Williams, who worked as a professional model in the 1990s, said she first met Trump in 1992 at a Christmas party after being introduced to him by Epstein, who she believed was a good friend of the then New York real estate developer. Williams said Epstein was interested in her and the two casually dated for a period of a few months. Speaking to CNN yesterday, she said Trump greeted them outside his office: The second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him, and his hands were just on me and didn\u2019t come off. And then the hands started moving, and they were on the, you know, on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt, back up, sort of then, you know \u2013 they were just on me the whole time. And I froze. I couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. I think I probably was trying to smile and go through the motions of being engaged the way you would in a social situation. But it was an out of body experience. So, I don\u2019t know if I spoke, I don\u2019t know if I answered questions, I don\u2019t know. It was one of the strangest moments of my life. More than 80 Nobel prize winners have endorsed Kamala Harris for the presidency, warning that Donald Trump would \u201cjeopardize any advancements in our standards of living\u201d given his earlier proposals for enormous cuts to science funding. In an open letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, 82 Nobel prize winners from the US in the fields of physics, chemistry, economics and medicine, said \u201cthis is the most consequential presidential election in a long time, perhaps ever, for the future of science and the United States\u201d. The letter, which commends Harris for recognizing that \u201cthe enormous increases in living standards and life expectancies over the past two centuries are largely the result of advances in science and technology\u201d, called Trump a potential threat to progress who could \u201cjeopardize any advancements in our standards of living and impede our responses to climate change\u201d. The Nobel laureates range from a physicist involved in the discovery of remnant light from the Big Bang, to an immunologist instrumental in the development of a specific type of Covid-19 vaccine. They include signatories who won Nobels this month such as molecular biologist Gary Ruvkun, chemist David Baker, physicist John Hopfield and economist Daron Acemoglu. Donald Trump, campaigning in the border swing state of Arizona on Thursday, called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. \u201cWe\u2019re like a garbage can, you know, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said that,\u201d Trump said in Tempe, Arizona, the home of Arizona State University. \u201cAnd every time I come up and talk about what they\u2019ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I\u2019ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it\u2019s a very accurate description.\u201d Candidates and their surrogates for both presidential campaigns are blitzing swing states like Arizona in the final two weeks before election day. The Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance held two campaign rallies in Arizona earlier this week. Joe Biden and the former president Barack Obama are set to visit this week, as is Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential pick. A banner behind the stage said, \u201cVote early!\u201d \u2013 a change in strategy for Republicans and Trump, who have cast doubt on early and mail-in voting by falsely claiming it is an avenue for widespread fraud. He said of Arizona voting: \u201cThey got a problem. Gotta make it too big to rig.\u201d An image of Trump, raised fist and bloodied ear after his assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, showed before he came out. Early on, he displayed on screens behind him the chart of migration that he has attributed with saving his life. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on Friday. Kamala Harris and Barack Obama shared the stage at her Georgia rally on Thursday night. Our video editors have put together this clip from the event: Bruce Springsteen urged voters to back Kamala Harris in the presidential election, warning that Donald Trump is a would-be \u201ctyrant\u201d. \u201cI want a president who reveres the constitution, who does not threaten but wants to protect and guide our great democracy, who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, who will fight for a woman\u2019s right to choose, and who wants to create a middle-class economy that will serve all our citizens,\u201d Springsteen said at the Thursday evening rally. The rally at James R Hallford Stadium in Clarkston, Georgia, drew about 20,000 people, according to the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign, which would make it her largest political rally yet, besting the 17,000 Harris drew in Greensboro, North Carolina, in early September. \u201cThere is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear: Kamala Harris. She\u2019s running to be the 47th president of the United States.\u201d The Born in the USA singer is among the many celebrities stumping for Harris; directors Spike Lee and Tyler Perry, as well as actor Samuel L Jackson, were also in attendance. Good morning and welcome to the US election live blog. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail over the next couple of hours. We start with news that vice-president Kamala Harris appeared with Barack Obama for the first time, offering closing arguments targeting Black voters in Atlanta\u2019s eastern suburbs, a vibrant, symbolic part of Georgia. \u201cOurs is a fight for the future,\u201d Harris said at the rally in Clarkston. She touched on familiar themes \u2013 reducing the costs of drugs, housing and groceries. \u201cI come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. Harris said she believes \u201chealthcare should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it\u201d, and said Trump would gut the Affordable Care Act and roll back the $35 cap on insulin. The Democratic nominee also reaffirmed her support for abortion rights, referring to the death of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia woman whose death was recently found to be a result of the state\u2019s abortion ban. Harris said: \u201cDonald Trump still refuses to acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused \u2026 women are being denied care during miscarriages.\u201d For more on the rally, see George Chidi\u2019s full report here: Meanwhile, in other news: The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother who died just weeks after Georgia\u2019s abortion ban went into effect, was in attendance at the Harris rally. Harris is expected to make another high profile appearance today, this time alongside Beyonc\u00e9 in Houston, where the vice-president hopes to rally support for Senate candidate Colin Allred. Donald Trump rallied supporters in Tempe, Arizona, where he spoke alongside Senate candidate Kari Lake. Earlier in the day, Trump made news when he vowed that, if elected, he would immediately fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents. Trump called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. \u201cWe\u2019re like a garbage can, you know, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever said that,\u201d Trump said in Tempe, the home of Arizona State University. \u201cAnd every time I come up and talk about what they\u2019ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I\u2019ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it\u2019s a very accurate description.\u201d Phoenix police arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there, damaging mail-in ballots. The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested another man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. An Arizona prosecutor said the second man had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. Joe Biden announced he will issue an apology for the US government\u2019s role in forcing thousands of Indigenous American children to attend Indian boarding schools \u2013 a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Indigenous American voters. More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump\u2019s direction. So far, Republicans have cast 32% of ballots, up from 27% at this point in 2020. Whereas Democrats have cast 42% of the votes, down from 47% at this point in the last presidential election.",

        "trailText": "Stars from Beyonc\u00e9 to Eva Longoria, Halle Berry and Meghan Markle supporting families and frontline workers",
        "bodyText": "Celebrities are chipping in to help the region that\u2019s helped them grow to prominence \u2013 southern California \u2013 as wildfires continue to sweep across the state. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Los Angeles-area fires had killed at least 25 people, displaced thousands of others and destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Two of the largest blazes, the Palisades and Eaton fires, had charred almost 40,000 acres (16,187 hectares) combined and were still only partially contained. Since the fires started early last week, stars from Beyonc\u00e9, Eva Longoria and Jamie Lee Curtis to Halle Berry, Meghan and Prince Harry, among others, have come together to support frontline workers and families affected by the fires. Celebrities, athletes and company executives are making generous monetary donations and volunteering their time at relief centers. Different ways to help fire victims in California are not at a premium. In Los Angeles, hundreds of GoFundMe campaigns are raising money to help families get back on their feet after losing their homes. Beyonc\u00e9 has donated $2.5m to the newly launched LA Fire Relief Fund, set forth by her charitable foundation, BeyGood. \u201cThe fund is earmarked to aid families in the Altadena/Pasadena area who lost their homes, and to churches and community centers to address the immediate needs of those affected by the wildfires,\u201d reads an Instagram post. Last week, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mother, Tina Knowles, posted on the social media platform that her Malibu bungalow had been destroyed in the fires. \u201cIt was my favorite place, my sanctuary, my sacred Happy Place. Now it is gone!!\u201d she wrote. \u201cGod Bless all the brave men and women in our fire department who risked their lives in dangerous conditions.\u201d Longoria announced a $50,000 donation to This Is About Humanity to support frontline workers and affected families. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy week,\u201d she said in an Instagram video, calling the fires \u201cdevastating for so many people\u201d who have lost cherished memories and hard-earned belongings. She said her family had evacuated their home after warnings and repeated alarms but are now hosting friends displaced from other areas. On Friday, Meghan and Harry appeared at an evacuation center and food bank in Pasadena, where they served food and spoke with locals, as well as emergency workers who were on the ground. The same day, Jennifer Garner volunteered with World Central Kitchen and chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s to feed firefighters and evacuees at the Jack in the Box in Altadena. Last week, the actor Jamie Lee Curtis, whose California neighborhood was among those devastated by the fires, said that her family would donate $1m to relief efforts. She made an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where she fought back tears as she described the damage in Pacific Palisades. \u201cWhere I live is on fire right now, literally the entire city of Pacific Palisades is on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is literally where I live \u2013 everything, the market I shop in, the schools my kids go to. Friends, many, many, many, many, many friends, now have lost their homes.\u201d Companies have also extended their help in the past week. Netflix and Comcast NBCUniversal each pledged $10m on Monday to support organizations helping victims of the Los Angeles-area wildfires. Ted Sarandos, the Netflix co-CEO, announced the company\u2019s donation would be divided among five recipients, including World Central Kitchen and the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation. Brian L Roberts, the Comcast corporation chair and CEO, allocated $2.5m of Comcast\u2019s commitment to Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles\u2019 ReBuild LA initiative. The remaining funds will go to other charitable foundations assisting victims. Sports teams are also pitching in to help families and businesses in southern California. Twelve professional Los Angeles sports teams \u2013 Angel City FC, and the Angels, Chargers, Clippers, Dodgers, Ducks, Galaxy, Kings, LAFC, Lakers, Rams and Sparks \u2013 announced a donation of more than $8m to wildfire relief organizations including the American Red Cross, the California Fire Foundation and the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation.",

        "trailText": "Kendrick Lamar celebrated his rap beef victory in a \u2018Canadian tuxedo\u2019, Chappell Roan called out the industry and Nashville finally backed Beyonc\u00e9",
        "bodyText": "Drake was humiliated It\u2019s the kind of stress dream that pop stars tell their therapists about: \u201cMy artistic rival won record and song of the year at the Grammys for a track attacking me, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Even Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d And so it came to pass for Drake, seeing Kendrick Lamar win for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim \u2013 a \u201cCanadian tuxedo\u201d, no less \u2013 while half the arena seemed to chant \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably a minor\u201d, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn\u2019t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards \u2013 and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar \u2013 the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake? Chappell Roan called for workers\u2019 rights \u2026 For all her playfulness on stage and on record, there\u2019s also a seriousness of intent to Chappell Roan: part of the reason she\u2019s so loved is that she totally devotes herself to her craft, selling every line she sings. That\u2019s played out in her earnest politics, too, whether upbraiding a hectoring paparazzo, fretting about who to back (if anyone) in the US presidential race, and championing the rights of queer people and Palestinians. At the Grammys, she used the platform of a best new artist win to advocate for workers\u2019 rights, namely her fellow musicians, with a \u201cdemand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\u201d She spoke of struggling to afford health insurance in her early career, saying: \u201cIt was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised to not have health[care]. If my label would have prioritised artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to \u2026 Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d \u2026 and Lady Gaga for trans rights As Donald Trump enshrines transphobia in American law, Lady Gaga spoke out, saying: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d She was speaking after winning best pop duo/group performance for Die With a Smile, with Bruno Mars. Doechii capped her breakthrough year \u2026 Twenty-six-year-old rapper Doechii beat some of the most venerable, successful and respected MCs in the US \u2013 Eminem, Future, J Cole and the paired-up Common and Pete Rock \u2013 to win best rap album, only the third woman to win this category after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. This caps a stunning breakthrough over the past year, with jaws floored by the emphatically enunciated, elastically rhythmic raps on her album Alligator Bites Don\u2019t Heal, and then again by performances such as on Stephen Colbert\u2019s talkshow, her braided hair fused to that of her dancers. Her performance on the Grammys\u2019 stage was even stronger, a brilliantly choreographed strut through Denial Is a River where \u2013 with some expert help from her DJ, Miss Milan \u2013 she kept her flow going through high kicks, trust falls and a suit-busting bikini reveal. \u2026 as did Sierra Ferrell With her fourth album, Ferrell made a clean sweep of the roots and Americana categories, winning all four of the awards she was nominated for (in a less brutally competitive year, she would have got a best new artist nomination too). Dressed in one of the night\u2019s wackier outfits \u2013 think East End pearly queen after five rounds of AI enhancement, complete with sceptre \u2013 she\u2019s travelled a long way from the trailer-dwelling and freight train-hopping of her youth, to become a multimillion-streaming performer. As country and pop do-si-do ever more tightly, Ferrell, Zach Bryan and more are winning millions of fans drawn to a more authentic and analogue-sounding version of this vintage American music. Beyonc\u00e9 finally won album of the year She may have been the most-awarded star in history, but given the industry places such stock in the album format, Beyonc\u00e9 not winning that category felt like a big snub \u2013 particularly given her self-titled album lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase (not remotely the best album that year or in his own catalogue), while her great masterpiece 4 wasn\u2019t even nominated. So that wrong has now been righted. Some may be dismayed that it took a country album to do it, rather than an R&amp;B, pop or dance record \u2013 and Cowboy Carter has plenty of longueurs and even outright missteps. But it also contains some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most imaginative and beautiful music \u2013 the way Riverdance flows into II Hands II Heaven makes it the loveliest brace of songs on an album in her catalogue. Its bigger win in some ways is best country album, showing that Beyonc\u00e9 has convinced not just the broad pool of voters in the general field categories, but also the Nashville establishment who vote for the country awards. An American won best global music album Matt B, a little-streamed musician born and raised in Illinois and based in the US, beat representatives from Spain (Antonio Rey), Peru (Ciro Hurtado), and Nigeria (superstars Tems and Rema) to win best global music album for Alkebulan II, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. His album certainly creates a global dialogue, as he explores his African heritage with multilingual lyrics, lilting Afro-pop, and guests such as South African poet Nomfundo Khambule. But as the US enters its protectionist era under Trump, there may be some disquiet at this win. A multimillionare businesswoman won best new age album It\u2019s a shame that the great Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician who died of cancer aged 71 in 2023 having changed the face of his country\u2019s popular music, wasn\u2019t honoured in the category for best new age, ambient or chant album. His nominated LP Opus was full of his very particular piano style, full of chords that feel cautious and yet intentional, and where sentimentality is offset by chalky, dissonant notes. Instead, he lost to the little-heard Triveni by Wouter Kellerman, Eru Matsumoto and Chandrika Tandon, the latter a businesswoman and philanthropist (and sister of former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi) who worked for McKinsey before starting her own financial services firm. The Academy still loves Chris Stapleton He lost to Beyonc\u00e9 in the country album category, but Stapleton notched up his fifth win in 10 years in the best country solo performance category, a mark of how much the country-voting portion of the Recording Academy adores this artist, who pleases both staunch traditionalists while being relatively progressive \u2013 that\u2019s 11 wins overall for him now. It\u2019s a shame, though, that he won with a low-stakes ballad from the same album as his win last year, while shutting out Shaboozey\u2019s pop culturally dominant A Bar Song (Tipsy) in the process. Chris Brown was awarded Way after his notorious assault on Rihanna, Chris Brown has been accused of a long list of crimes against numerous women over the years, which he has denied \u2013 last week he sued over how he was represented in a new documentary, with lawyers saying: \u201cMr Brown has never been found guilty of any sex related crime \u2026 but this documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.\u201d His win for best R&amp;B album, over a big breakthrough by Muni Long and another veteran in Usher, plus others, shows that he still has his backers in the Recording Academy. But there has been disquiet online \u2013 just as there has for Kanye West\u2019s red carpet appearance with his wife, Bianca Censori essentially appearing nude, the latest in a series of mute, near-undressed appearances alongside him that have provoked widespread concern for her welfare. Female artists did well \u2013 but men still dominate behind the scenes Two of the \u201cbig four\u201d were won by female artists, but when you look into the actual winners, they were overwhelmingly male. These awards are shared by the producers, songwriters, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers and while there is some heartening female representation \u2013 such as Idania Valencia who mastered Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, and songwriters such as Elizabeth Lowell Boland and songwriter of the year winner Amy Allen \u2013 analysis by Akas found that only 9% of winners in the top four categories were women. And it was a bad night for the Brits Charli xcx was the chief British representative, and she gave an instantly viral bum-wiggling, underwear-chucking live performance of Guess on the night, but she was shut out of the big prizes, making do with dance-pop awards. And it wasn\u2019t a great night for other Brits. Belfast\u2019s Jordan Adetunji was beaten to the melodic rap prize by Rapsody and Erykah Badu, Raye lost out twice, while Jacob Collier\u2019s seventh win was a minor award, for arrangement. Instead we had to rely on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones for some face-saving wins, for best rock performance and album respectively (while Sean Ono Lennon also picked up an award, for co-creating the box set release of his father\u2019s album Mind Games). \u2022 This article was updated on 3 February with a correction: Beyonce\u2019s self-titled album, not Lemonade, lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase.",

        "bodyText": "A \u201cvery different\u201d Grammy awards will take place in Los Angeles this weekend, impacted by the recent wildfires that have affected California. The annual celebration of music, taking place at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday, will still feature a range of big-name performers but there will be a noticeable shift in purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical Grammy party atmosphere,\u201d said Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the Recording Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only \u2018the show must go on\u2019 but the show must provide a greater service. Of course, we\u2019re going to honor music, but our goal is to utilise music to make a difference.\u201d The week leading to the Grammys typically sees a string of major parties put on by record labels, but the majority have been cancelled in response to the fires, which have killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of structures. Money will instead be diverted to those in need. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\u201d Mason said. \u201cIt will honour some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d The annual tradition that will go ahead in Clive Davis\u2019s legendary gala, which takes place the night before. This year\u2019s event will also include a fundraising element. \u201cWe want to ensure that the evening will not only be a memorable night of music but will also provide impactful support for those very much in need,\u201d Davis said. This year\u2019s nominees are led by Beyonc\u00e9, whose country album Cowboy Carter brought her 11 nods, making her the most nominated artist ever alongside husband Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to win the award for album of the year and if she wins this weekend, she would be only the fourth Black woman to take it home. The star has been nominated for the award four times before. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d Jay-Z said last year on stage. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has already become the first solo Black female to top the country charts in the US and could make history if she wins in the country categories on Sunday. The singer, whose mother Tina Knowles lost a home in the fires, has donated $2.5m to relief efforts. In the category of album of the year, she faces competition from stars including Andr\u00e9 3000, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx and Taylor Swift, who won last year. Swift, who has now won 14 Grammys, has also donated to a number of wildfire funds. In an Instagram statement, urging others to also contribute, she wrote that it was \u201cheartbreaking to see the stories unfold\u201d. The singer has been confirmed to present an award on Sunday. The evening will be hosted by Trevor Noah and feature performances from multiple nominees Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter with a special tribute to the late Quincy Jones, featuring Stevie Wonder and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. \u201cIt\u2019s Grammy week,\u201d Roan wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \u201cI am very emo. My heart feels warm and fuzzy with all the support I have been given this past year. I hope you can understand that this has been incredible and scary and spiritual and confusing.\u201d The evening lands in the middle of an awards season that has seen delays and shifts as a result of the ongoing wildfires. The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and a tweaked ceremony will remove original song performances and spend more time trying to \u201cacknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires\u201d. The Critics Choice awards were also delayed until 7 February. This week also saw a benefit concert in Los Angeles with stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Joni Mitchell performing.",

        "trailText": "It\u2019s tough to call the quality-stacked top categories, featuring Academy darlings such as Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift alongside pop\u2019s new tyros",
        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink). Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best country solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 16 Carriages Jelly Roll \u2013 I Am Not Okay Kacey Musgraves \u2013 The Architect Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Chris Stapleton \u2013 It Takes a Woman In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "bodyText": "Like all major awards ceremonies, the Grammys spawn a mini-industry in predictions: in the weeks before the winners are announced, a rash of articles inevitably appear in which expert voices scan the nominations and foretell who\u2019s going to win. This year, you didn\u2019t really need in-depth knowledge of the music industry or the Recording Academy\u2019s internal machinations to work out what was going to happen, unless there was a major upset. Across the previous 12 months, a succession of artists impacted in a way that pop music is no longer supposed to do. Its once-central defining role within broader popular culture is held to have been vastly diminished by social media, and yet Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us wasn\u2019t just a huge commercial success, it influenced everything, from US sports to the campaign messaging of the American presidential election to sales of the fashion brands featured in its video: if you were going to dub anything the song of the year, it was obviously going to be that. Likewise, Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, an album which caught a mood so completely, its title wound up a widely used (if nebulously defined) adjective: the notion of it ending the night unrewarded seemed fairly unthinkable (though it didn\u2019t triumph in its biggest nominated categories). Moreover, Brat was part of a noticeable shift in the tone of mainstream pop music, away from impeccably styled, media-trained, Instagram-filtered perfection towards something messier, more heartfelt and personal, a state of affairs it would have been faintly nuts for the Academy not to recognise. This wasn\u2019t merely the kind of trend that provokes think pieces from critics and ups the general quality of pop music \u2013 it was one that also sold millions of records by Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, both of whom deservedly did well on the night. Should anyone doubt that a new mood in pop is abroad, it\u2019s worth noting that Roan turned up to the ceremony wearing a wimple and drag-queen makeup and spent her acceptance speech excoriating the music industry for its unwillingness to provide young artists with a living wage in an era of record profits. You probably wouldn\u2019t have expected that from the best new artist winner a few years back, but it\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that Chappell Roan does: she\u2019s both impressively outspoken and possessed of a very original take on how a pop star should look. Elsewhere, you could certainly argue the Beyonc\u00e9 albums that failed to snare the album of the year category in previous years were qualitatively better than the album that finally won it \u2013 certainly, 2016\u2019s Lemonade and 2022\u2019s Renaissance were more consistent and conceptually more coherent \u2013 but you\u2019d be harder pushed to make a case that Cowboy Carter wasn\u2019t impactful enough. For all it seemed to tire of its Beyonc\u00e9-goes-country theme midway through, throwing in everything from hip-hop to psychedelic soul, Cowboy Carter felt of the moment. It featured Shaboozey \u2013 ahead of his single A Bar Song (Tipsy) spending a record-setting 19 weeks at the top of the US chart \u2013 and it was part of the ongoing vogue for pop artists shifting their sound towards something more country-adjacent, unencumbered by the kind of this-isn\u2019t-country dismissal from Nashville that famously dogged Lil Nas X\u2019s similarly successful Old Town Road five years ago. Indeed, the closest the Grammys came to controversy \u2013 aside from awards for Chris Brown and Dave Chappelle, and a provocative appearance by Kanye West and his wife \u2013 was when it seemed most traditional, handing out the best rock performance gong to the Beatles for Now and Then. You could view that as merely an act of sentiment \u2013 Now and Then was, after all, dubbed \u201cthe last Beatles single\u201d, a final leave-taking from the biggest band of all time \u2013 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that it was a rock performance that required AI to make it happen, previous attempts at extracting a usable vocal from John Lennon\u2019s unfinished 1977 demo having failed because the equipment wasn\u2019t up to it. The rights and wrongs of using AI in music have been hotly debated and one way you could read Now and Then\u2019s success is as a tacit thumbs-up from the music business for a deeply divisive technology, or at least a hopeful suggestion that it might be a wonderful tool rather than a catastrophe for creativity. You have to admire their optimism.",

        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",

        "bodyText": "What\u2019s the best piece of advice you have ever received? There\u2019s a saying that I first heard said by RuPaul: what other people think of you is none of your business. That is something that has helped me loads over the years. I get a lot of shit from the far right and I think it could have bothered me a lot more at times if I didn\u2019t remind myself of that saying. And I like it because it\u2019s not saying \u201cignore what other people say\u201d; it\u2019s almost giving you a telling off \u2013 it\u2019s just none of your business. I think it makes it much easier to move through the world and not give a shit what other people think. Do you have a nemesis? There is a rightwing Christian organisation called the Iona Institute that has been at the forefront of every regressive campaign in Ireland \u2013 [including] against abortion and against gay marriage. Famously, they made defamation threats over some stuff I said about them 11 years ago on RT\u00c9, our national broadcaster, and RT\u00c9 apologised and made a big damages payout \u2013 it became quite the scandal. I wouldn\u2019t like to big them up by saying that they\u2019re my nemesis but I guess I won\u2019t let an opportunity pass to let people know what dicks I think they are. What is your favourite place in the world to visit? Tokyo. I went to Tokyo after college, when I was in my 20s. At that time, the mid-90s, Ireland was a pretty grim place to be queer. Homosexuality was still a crime. So I was like, \u201cI want to get out of this backwards shithole!\u201d I went to the library and got out an encyclopedia and looked up the largest cities and they were Mexico City and Tokyo. I\u2019d heard you could teach English in Tokyo. I had also read a book by Paul Theroux about train journeys in China, so I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going on my life\u2019s big adventure, I\u2019m going to go to Tokyo by train and then take the Trans-Siberian express.\u201d So off I went to Tokyo and I lived there for four and a half years. I loved everything about it. I still love it \u2013 I don\u2019t get to visit as often as I would like. Tokyo holds so many special memories \u2013 exploring the world and doing wild things, taking drugs and being stupid, becoming a professional drag queen for the first time. You own two bars in Dublin; what\u2019s your tipple of choice? You know, for somebody who owns two bars and has spent most of my life working in establishments that sold alcohol, I\u2019m actually a very boring drinker. I like an ordinary pilsner or lager that\u2019s bland and not too tasty. If I\u2019m in drag I don\u2019t like drinking pints \u2013 it makes my hands look smaller but it\u2019s not very [glamorous] \u2013 so I drink gin and tonics. My glamorous American aunt used to always drink gin and tonics. What\u2019s been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity? I\u2019m not that fussed about celebrities, generally. The only celebrity who makes me lose my mind is Dolly Parton. She\u2019s my everything. But I once ended up with Madonna in an empty restaurant for two hours. We\u2019d been to a funeral in the Dublin mountains and the only people who skipped the cemetery part \u2013 after the church service \u2013 were me and my two friends and her and her two friends, so we all arrived at the restaurant in a very fancy hotel two hours before everybody else. She knows my brother, so she walked up to me and said, \u201cShould I know you?\u201d She was fun but her default setting is kind of \u201cjokey cunt\u201d. The slightly cringy part is that my friend Sergio needed a lift back to Dublin, and I sort of turned into my mother, and I\u2019m like: \u201cMadonna, you could give Sergio a lift back into town, couldn\u2019t you? Plenty of room in that car!\u201d Madonna went, \u201cOh, well, we came from Dublin international airport.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s on the way, you could drop him on the way \u2013 perfect.\u201d And in fairness to Madonna, she did give Sergio a lift back to town. What\u2019s your No 1 petty gripe? This is one for Australians: shut the fuck up about coffee. Like, the whole thing has become so annoying. Everyone has all their rules and it has to be this way or that way. You can watch these 20-minute videos on YouTube of someone showing you how to make a fucking filter coffee. It\u2019s gone way too far. I\u2019ve used a Moka pot [stovetop espresso] every morning for the last 20-something years, and it\u2019s absolutely perfect \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t matter a fuck whether I put boiling water into it or water at room temperature, it\u2019s not gonna burn the coffee. Anyway, nobody can even taste the fucking coffee once you put in milk or a bit of sugar. Everybody needs to calm the fuck down. It\u2019s just a drink that half of the world drinks, get over yourselves. What book, album or film do you always return to, and why? The 1969 film The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Maggie Smith won the Oscar for it, and everything about that movie is perfect \u2013 especially Maggie, obviously, but her clothes, her costumes, the throwaway lines that she says. It\u2019s so quotable. I have four different versions of the poster in my living room. The book by Muriel Spark is amazing, too. Whenever Panti is working with somebody new on a big project, I always make sure that they go and watch that movie first, because if they haven\u2019t seen it, they\u2019re not really going to get half of my references. So much about Panti comes from Maggie Smith in that movie \u2013 the clothes, the way she holds herself, her attitude. What\u2019s your most controversial pop-culture opinion? Beyonc\u00e9 is not a very good singer. She\u2019s an incredible performer \u2013 one of the best live performers ever. And yes, she hits every note. But there\u2019s no crack in her voice to let the light in. It\u2019s all so perfect; it has this hard gloss that I can\u2019t fall in love with. So I\u2019ll watch every live performance of hers \u2013 she\u2019s incredible \u2013 but do I think that other people could sing the songs better? Yeah, I do. The gays will never forgive me for that but that\u2019s just how I feel. If you had to fight a famous person, who would it be, how would you fight them and who would win? Bindi Irwin, jelly wrestling, and I would win. Clearly she\u2019s a fit young woman, she\u2019s used to wrestling koalas and crocodiles. I know how the Irwins are thought of in Australia but I figure I might as well make a splash if I\u2019m going to do it, and I think Australia would be glued to that match. And I think we should jelly wrestle, because about 15 years ago I went to a gay nightclub in Brisbane on a Tuesday night and there were literally seven people in there, and they were having a jelly wrestling night. I had to wrestle a young lesbian and I won. It\u2019s a fond memory. What song do you want played at your funeral? Little Sparrow by Dolly Parton. It\u2019s from one of her bluegrass albums. It\u2019s achingly beautiful. And people would be bawling their eyes out behind their dramatic black veils, which they better be fucking wearing. Rory O\u2019Neill is touring his one-woman show Panti Bliss: If These Wigs Could Talk to Arts Centre Melbourne, 4-9 February; Brunswick Picture House in Brunswick Heads, 11-12 February; and the Factory Theatre in Sydney, 25-26 February",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight. I don\u2019t think she hates to say it at all. LS",

        "bodyText": "The Weeknd has pushed the release of his new album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, because of the California wildfires, as well as cancelling a one-off performance at the city\u2019s Rose Bowl venue on 25 January \u201cout of respect and concern for the people of LA county\u201d. Hurry Up Tomorrow was due for release on 24 January. It will now arrive a week later on 31 January. \u201cThis city has always been a profound source of inspiration for me, and my thoughts are with everyone impacted during this difficult time,\u201d the musician, AKA Abel Tesfaye, said in a statement posted to Instagram. Hurry Up Tomorrow is the sixth album by the Weeknd, the final part of a trilogy alongside After Hours and Dawn FM \u2013 and purportedly the last album under Tesfaye\u2019s stage name. \u201cAs the Weeknd, I\u2019ve said everything I can say,\u201d Tesfaye told W magazine in 2023. \u201cI\u2019ll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as the Weeknd. But I still want to kill the Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I\u2019m definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.\u201d The album is set to feature Playboi Carti, Anitta, Max Martin and Pharrell Williams among others. Tesfaye\u2019s focus now, he wrote in a statement, \u201cremains on supporting the recovery of these communities and aiding its incredible people as they rebuild\u201d. Tesfaye\u2019s XO Humanitarian Fund has previously donated $4.5m (\u00a33.7m) to hunger relief efforts in Gaza. As LA firefighters prepare for dangerous winds to return and further fan the disastrous wildfires, Beyonc\u00e9 has also delayed an announcement planned for 14 January. \u201cI continue to pray for healing and rebuilding for the families suffering from trauma and loss,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are so blessed to have brave first responders who continue to work tirelessly to protect the Los Angeles community.\u201d The musician called for people to join her BeyGood foundation in supporting the victims of the fire after it donated $2.5m to fire relief efforts. Meanwhile the Grammy awards ceremony, set to take place at LA\u2019s Crypto.com arena, will continue on 2 February as planned, Recording Academy Group CEO Harvey Mason Jr confirmed. \u201cThis year\u2019s show, however, will carry a renewed sense of purpose,\u201d said Mason Jr, \u201craising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honouring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d Universal Music Group posted that it would cancel all of the label\u2019s Grammy-related events, including artists showcases and parties, and redirect the resources to efforts to support those affected by the fires.",

        "headline": "\u2018George Clooney \u2013 who cares?\u2019 Did celebrity endorsements actually harm Kamala Harris?",
        "trailText": "Charli xcx, Taylor Swift, George Clooney and Beyonc\u00e9 all voiced their approval for the Democratic candidate. But do these endorsements do more for the stars than for the politician?",
        "bodyText": "Back in July, Charli xcx posted a three-word tweet that some commentators thought might help swing the US election. Arriving the day after Kamala Harris announced her bid for the presidency, Charli\u2019s tweet said simply: \u201cKamala IS Brat.\u201d It was a reference to Charli\u2019s latest album, Brat, which had dominated the pop cultural landscape all summer and was loaded with synth-pop bangers, drug references and tales from a life spent getting messy on dancefloors. It wasn\u2019t perhaps the most obvious comparison to make with the then 59-year-old US vice-president, but the overall meaning was clear: Kamala was the presidential candidate with the most energy and authenticity \u2013 and had the approval of the pop star of the moment. The Harris campaign leaned into the endorsement, changing the backdrop of its official X page to the same garish green colour used on the record\u2019s sleeve. It helped mark Harris out as a different, more dynamic candidate than her faltering predecessor: Joe Biden may have been many things but he was most certainly not Brat. Yet as the dust settles on an extremely depressing election result, it appears clear that not only did Charli xcx\u2019s tweet have no meaningful impact on the election result, nor did the endorsement of any celebrity. Just look at the list of backers lined up for Harris. Taylor Swift, the world\u2019s biggest popstar, came out for her after the September debate, writing that Harris \u201cfights for the rights and causes I believe\u201d and signing off as a \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d \u2013 a dig at comments made by Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick JD Vance. Harrison Ford recorded a video, looking grave as he warned voters about what a danger Trump would be to democracy. And then there was Beyonc\u00e9, who even appeared at one of Harris\u2019s rallies, alongside fellow Destiny\u2019s Child member Kelly Rowland. Speaking from the stage, Beyonc\u00e9 said she was there \u201cas a mother who cares deeply about a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we\u2019re not divided\u201d. You can add to these names endorsements from the likes of LeBron James, George Clooney, Bruce Springsteen, Oprah, Lizzo, J-Lo, Eminem, Arnold Schwarzenegger and countless more. Game, set and match to Harris? Hardly. So why did their voices have so little impact? Seth Abramovitch, senior writer at the Hollywood Reporter, says that Harris\u2019s nominations were ineffective because they came largely from celebrities who were preaching to the choir: \u201cOprah, Katy Perry, Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Ariana Grande \u2013 these are artists whose audiences (black, female, liberal, queer) were already inclined to vote for Kamala.\u201d The exception to this, he says, was Swift, whose popularity in the worlds of country music and pop means she appeals to both sides of a divided US. \u201cYet I\u2019d argue her massive influence does not reach two key demographic groups that helped Trump win this time \u2013 Latinos and black men.\u201d Margaretha Bentley is a professor at Arizona State University whose classes have studied the social importance of Swift. \u201cIn the academic literature,\u201d she says, \u201cresearch has shown that, while celebrity endorsements can increase civic engagement and voter registrations, it has not proven to have a direct impact on how people make their voting decisions.\u201d Bentley likes to ask her students what influences their vote, and the overwhelming majority of responses mention family (especially parents), friends and personal values. \u201cVoters may do more research after a celebrity endorses, but they will vote based on their own values and not necessarily the values of the celebrity endorser.\u201d Recent data seem to back that up. The vote.gov website received 405,999 visitors in the 24 hours after Swift shared its URL with her followers. \u201cThere is robust evidence that celebrities do have a real impact in promoting overall, nonpartisan civic engagement \u2013 from encouraging voter registration to poll worker signups,\u201d says Ashley Spillane who authored Celebrities Strengthening Our Culture of Democracy, a Harvard study published in August. But the same report also found that it was hard to quantify whether an increased drive of voters to the polls corresponded with positive outcomes for the endorsed candidate. So if people are not going to vote in the way the endorsed campaign wants, is there any actual value in seeking out an endorsement? \u201cThat\u2019s a great question and one that the research has not fully been able to answer,\u201d says Bentley. \u201cFrom my standpoint, as an educator, if celebrity endorsements encourage civic engagement, then that is a good thing.\u201d Of course, courting celebrities is nothing new. Ahead of the 1920 election, Al Jolson led a march of fellow actors through the streets of Ohio in support of Republican Warren G Harding\u2019s bid, and even penned what became the official campaign song. Endorsements from Babe Ruth, Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand have all been coveted by the candidates of their day \u2013 and possibly with good reason. A 2008 study by Northwestern University, for instance, claimed that Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement of Barack Obama added around a million votes to his final tally. But that was in a very different political landscape. A poll from YouGov shortly after Swift\u2019s endorsement found that only 8% of voters would be \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cmuch more\u201d likely to vote for Harris \u2013 with a surprising 20% saying the endorsement actually made them less likely to vote for her. Has there been a recent shift in the way we view celebrity endorsements? Laurence F Maslon, an arts professor at New York University, doesn\u2019t believe so. \u201cI think endorsements have probably always done more for the celebrity than the person being endorsed. I think sometimes it\u2019s a way to hitch your star to somebody who seems to be good for you, and maybe there\u2019s a certain kind of reflected glory in that,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you look at, say, Sinatra\u2019s endorsement of John F Kennedy, that was probably more of a big deal for Sinatra, because it allowed him to get a seat at the table and he probably thought it would help him achieve that next level of stardom.\u201d Still, Maslon accepts that there has been a concerted effort by the Republican party over the past few decades to counter the fact that Democrats receive the biggest celebrity endorsements. \u201cThere\u2019s probably not a Republican candidate for any office in the last 20 years who didn\u2019t append the word liberal before the word Hollywood when speaking about it,\u201d he says. Ultimately, it means a celebrity endorsement becomes baked into the overall discourse. \u201cPeople like George Clooney and Robert De Niro, I mean, who cares, frankly?\u201d Certainly, Republicans have made a great deal out of the idea of \u201celites\u201d in recent years, feeding into the idea that what works for a celebrity is not necessarily what\u2019s in the best interests of the average person on the street. Beyonc\u00e9, the argument goes, is hardly likely to be worrying about the price of gas. The view that celebrities are so divorced from real life that they\u2019re not worth listening to is encapsulated by a brief Ricky Gervais video posted in June, which resurfaced as a viral meme just before the election: \u201cAs a celebrity, I know all about stuff like science and politics so trust me when I tell you who you should vote for,\u201d Gervais says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote the right way, it\u2019s like a hate crime and that makes me sad and angry and I\u2019ll leave the country and you don\u2019t want that.\u201d You may find that view of democracy \u2013 that we all know so little we should refrain from using our voices \u2013 unbelievably cynical. But it taps into a backlash against endorsements that, in recent years, has taken a darker turn with the rise of QAnon and other conspiracy theories regarding the alleged perversions of Hollywood stars. During this year\u2019s cycle, endorsements were often countered online by Trump supporters arguing that the celebrity in question would have been present at parties hosted by Diddy, the rapper and record executive who is now in jail charged with sex trafficking and racketeering. By linking the two, and implying that liberal celebrities were in some way at least conscious of Diddy\u2019s alleged crimes, they serve to undermine the whole power of celebrity itself, rebranding it from something glitzy and desirable to the face of evil. But then conspiracy theories during elections are nothing new. \u201cThere will always be a segment of voters who mistrust celebrity and Hollywood and lean into conspiracy theories,\u201d says Abramovitch. Despite all this, nobody would be surprised to see politicians clambering for endorsements when the next election comes around. After all, there\u2019s nothing to say they actively harmed Harris\u2019s campaign \u2013 she may have done much worse without them. Even Maslon admits that \u201cto have the most famous black female singer in the world not endorse Harris probably would have been a big negative, just by implication\u201d. Ultimately, Maslon says, there is really only one celebrity endorsement that has been shown to make a huge difference in US elections \u2013 and that\u2019s when the candidate is already a celebrity. \u201cAnd so they endorse themselves!\u201d He cites George Murphy, the 1940s movie star who ran successfully to become the senator for California, paving the way for the likes of Ronald Reagan, Schwarzenegger and of course Trump. \u201cIt seems to happen a lot in the Republican party,\u201d he says. So if Swift or Beyonc\u00e9 really want their celebrity star power to have an effect on the polls, perhaps they\u2019ll have to ditch the endorsements and run for office themselves. Just not for the party they currently support.",

        "bodyText": "I have lived through some big societal changes in my many years on this ever-heating planet. For example, I recently told younger friends that as a teen I had to buy CD-Roms that gave me a certain number of hours of internet access, and then it would stop. I saw in their baffled little eyes that they were now picturing me in black and white, waving goodbye to the CD-Rom-monger as I boarded my horse and buggy. I\u2019ve also lived through big changes in LGBTQ+ rights. I was closeted till age 21, whereas many more young people can now be their true selves from the jump \u2013 celebrated instead of tolerated. Then there is the biggest change of all, one that I never thought I would see as long as I lived, and that is \u2026 country music is cool now. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning I can\u2019t believe it. As someone who has loved country music since I yeehaw\u2019d out of my mother (sorry), I have been watching this vibe shift with feverish anticipation over recent years. There was Lil Nas X\u2019s breakout moment in 2019, with his country-crossover hit Old Town Road. Years after doing the song Daddy Lessons with the Chicks, Beyonc\u00e9 released her full country album Cowboy Carter in 2024 \u2013 putting a huge spotlight on country\u2019s roots in black history, and its future black stars. Post Malone transitioned from rap to country with huge success. Hip-hop country singer Shaboozey also had a massive crossover hit last year with A Bar Song (Tipsy). All of these moments have had ripple effects on popular music. We are now seeing country calling, and even the pop girlies are leaning into it. I\u2019ve finally been vindicated, I\u2019m finally cool. Last week one of the biggest pop stars on the planet right now, Chappell Roan, released a heavily country-vibed song called The Giver, which is about queer sex. It would probably have immediately killed 10-year-old me if she heard it. It\u2019s a big change from the country music of my childhood. My dad influenced my taste in musicians like Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. At around age 10 I heard Patsy Cline for the first time, her plaintive and stunning voice blowing my mind. I listened to Loretta Lynn, Reba, Charley Pride. I got addicted to Garth Brooks (who was recently accused of sexual assault, extreme bummer \u2013 he denies the allegations). I found the Chicks when I was a bit older \u2013 perfect timing for someone starting to care about politics, and uncomfortable with the old-school conservative country ways behind the music. Even though modern country has only recently started to include openly queer artists, I actually think it was my hidden queerness that drew me to it. The country music stereotype is often mocked (\u201cI went to wash my truck and my wife left me and I\u2019m gutted and my dog is also gone\u201d), but I think it was that plainness that attracted me. I was closeted from the age of 10 (no, Patsy did not make me gay, but she helped) to about 21. The only way to survive was to completely shove down my feelings, disconnecting the wires that could cause emotions. I lived not being able to express myself, in the fear I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. Country ballads, country love songs \u2013 these were always the ones that to me were full of the most emotion, most clearly expressed. Nobody was hiding anything, they weren\u2019t shoving down their true selves. They were singing full-throated and plainly. They were doing exactly what I couldn\u2019t do. Playing those songs and singing along loudly let me release a little bit of the pressure inside me. It was good for me, but kids at my various schools were not interested in singing Trisha Yearwood with me for some reason. The mainstream around me never really accepted country music. But look at us now. I\u2019m happily and loudly gay, and all the popular kids are coming over to my side. Beyonc\u00e9, Chappell. Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s best song is Please Please Please, which has a country bent. Lana Del Rey has an upcoming country album. Orville Peck, a gay country singer who always wears a mask, is on the rise, having recently performed a song called Friends of Dorothy with the Wiggles. One of the most popular drag queens in the world, Trixie Mattel, makes beautiful folk-country music. Queer line dancing is taking over Sydney. Cowboy hats and flannels are no longer just the realm of country, or lesbians. I\u2019ve long endured terminal uncoolness, people groaning when my songs come on, mocking me for being a country bumpkin. There have been a few allies of course, other fans with whom I could watch Garth Brooks\u2019s 1992 concert (RIP), or scream-sing Not Ready to Make Nice by the Chicks in a car. It\u2019s been a long and winding road (Sheryl Crow), and it\u2019s often been a lonely road, but I am finally getting my reward. Now I can turn on the radio and hear the biggest stars in the world singing over a ukulele. I can blast a countrified song, look around and see people smiling instead of grimacing. I hope this means that many more people will discover other types of country and appreciate the scope of the genre. But I\u2019m greedy. While some country fans wring their hands and whine about the purity of the genre, I want more. I want Taylor Swift to go back to her roots and do a country album. I think Miley Cyrus would make an incredible country album. I want Doechii to collab with Kacey Musgraves. I want everyone I enjoy in every genre to make a countrified album. I deserve it, and every time a new country song is released by someone I love, my inner child yahoos and waves her cowboy hat around \u2013 this town ain\u2019t big enough any more for country music haters.

        "headline": "The gig economy: ticket inflation is getting worse, so where does all the money go?",
        "trailText": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour and the Gallaghers\u2019 ill-fated dabble with dynamic pricing have put the spotlight on how much we\u2019re willing to pay for live music. But, on the other side of the equation, the costs can be exorbitant and the risks are eye-watering",
        "bodyText": "The news that Oasis were to reunite sparked a wave of euphoria across the nation at the end of last summer. But the nostalgia balloon was quickly punctured by the discovery that the tickets, initially priced at \u00a3148.50, had suddenly leapt to \u00a3355.20 due to dynamic pricing. The outcry quickly sparked a new debate about what constitutes a \u201cfair\u201d price for gig tickets, with the band themselves fanning the flames: Liam Gallagher told those bellyaching about the lack of transparency to \u201cSHUTUP\u201d and buy \u201cKneeling only\u201d tickets for \u00a3100,000 instead. Dynamic pricing, where the cost rises in real time in lockstep with demand, is hardly new. Parallels are often made with the surge pricing used on budget airlines and taxi-booking apps, although in the case of gig tickets, dynamic pricing means the price can rise in the few seconds it takes for consumers to complete their booking. Bruce Springsteen was caught up in the issue in 2022 for his US tour, as were huge acts such as Beyonc\u00e9, Harry Styles, Coldplay and Blackpink for their UK shows. With costs rising across a number of industries and people\u2019s pay packets being squeezed to breaking point, it seems reasonable to ask what truly constitutes a fair price. I spoke to a range of voices across the live music business \u2013 ticketing companies, agents, promoters and artist managers \u2013 to understand not just how prices are set but also what costs need to be covered by gig revenues. Average ticket prices globally rose 23.3% in 2023 to $130.81 (\u00a3104.36), according to data from the live industry trade publication Pollstar, a figure that is almost 10 times the national living wage per hour (currently \u00a311.44 but soon to rise to \u00a312.21). That Pollstar number is, however, heavily skewed at the top end by huge acts charging huge prices for their huge shows. Go down the food chain from Oasis and Taylor Swift, who grossed more than $2bn last year, to mid-sized and smaller acts, and it becomes painfully clear that concert tickets are not the cash bonanza of common presumption. Looking at London, which has the highest concentration of concerts and venues in the UK, tickets at the 5,000-capacity O2 Academy Brixton typically cost between \u00a340 and \u00a350 (before booking fees). A ticket for the 2,300-capacity O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London, can land between \u00a322.85 and \u00a340. A ticket for the 150-capacity Windmill pub in Brixton could be as little as \u00a36 but is rarely over \u00a312. How that revenue is broken down is complex, but the act you are paying to see only ever sees a fraction of that. \u201cTicket prices have barely moved in the 15 years I\u2019ve been doing this, especially on a grassroots level,\u201d says Matt Hanner, founder of booking agency Runway, who looks after emerging acts such as Aussie post-punkers Coldwave, with tickets to see them at the Prince Albert in Brighton in March costing \u00a311.44. Tom Schroeder is EVP of live agency Wasserman Music UK and his roster includes Fred Again and Raye, both of whom are now at, or approaching, arena level. \u201cHaving run 500-capacity and 700-capacity venues myself, the margins are tiny,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, people are losing money.\u201d Phil Hutcheon, founder and CEO of mobile ticketing company Dice, set his company up in part to help smaller acts and independent venues sell more tickets and understands how perilous the economics are. \u201cMid-sized and small concert tickets are actually underpriced for what you get,\u201d he says. \u201cUS tickets are typically 50 to 60% higher than in the UK. The US feels a bit too expensive and in the UK it feels like fans could pay a little more.\u201d A music manager, speaking anonymously, explains that for at least one of their acts, who can play to 1,000 people in London, the cost of all their shows far exceed their fees, even with a minimal crew. At the smallest level, show losses can be substantial as they rarely sell out. \u201cAs a promoter, you can easily lose \u00a31,000 on a 100-capacity gig,\u201d says Hanner. \u201cYou are looking for acts that are going to move through the venues and get to a point where they\u2019re making serious money, which really only happens at 5,000-capacity venues onwards.\u201d When acts get to the arena stage, things don\u2019t suddenly become trouble-free. Overheads rise sharply and that has to be reflected in ticket prices. \u201cOn bigger shows, it\u2019s hard not to spend money on production as the audience has a level of expectation and there\u2019s a level of investment by the artist in having to do that,\u201d says Niamh Byrne, co-founder of Eleven Management, which represents Blur, Gorillaz and Bastille, among others. When spending on huge productions rises, acts will also have to ask for higher guaranteed fees to cover them. (When acts are initially booked, they are offered a fixed fee by the promoter but they may also share in ticket income if the show sells beyond expectations.) Unless arena and stadium shows completely sell out, promoters could still lose money: as the commonly quoted industry figure goes, profits are really only made in the last 10% of ticket sales. As a result, some acts and promoters feel compelled to jack up prices to cover themselves. \u201cFor American acts [playing arenas in the UK], tickets will be well in excess of \u00a3100,\u201d says Ian McAndrew of Wildlife Entertainment, manager of Arctic Monkeys and Fontaines DC. \u201cAmericans generally spend more on production and look for higher margins of profit. They can argue they less commonly come into the country so there\u2019s a premium to see them.\u201d There are exceptions. Paul Heaton\u2019s most recent tour has seen the former Beautiful South man play stripped-back arena shows enabling him to charge \u00a335 a ticket. Most nights sold out and his planned show at the O2 City Hall Newcastle in December was upgraded to the city\u2019s much larger Utilita Arena. A bare-bones production, however, would not work for acts such as Dua Lipa, Bring Me the Horizon, Beyonc\u00e9 or Kendrick Lamar. Their shows at arenas and stadiums need to astound. But as shows scale up, so do associated costs. McAndrew explains that an arena show requires at least six articulated lorries to transport everything, as well as a crew of around 45 people \u2013 from roadies and riggers to tour managers and sound/lighting engineers \u2013 who all have to be bussed or flown between shows. \u201cThe actual profit won\u2019t be as significant as you might think because the costs are quite high,\u201d he says. Ticket prices are usually set by the promoter who takes the biggest risk, typically working on 20% of profits after venue hire and the act\u2019s guaranteed fee. The promoter will normally speak to the act and their agents about the proposed price to see if they feel it is not excessive for their fans or drastically out of step with the market. If they do not sell all the tickets, the act still gets their fee but the promoter absorbs the loss. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation between the agent and the artist as to what the ticket price should be,\u201d says Byrne. But what about the people selling the tickets? Laura Kramer, director and CEO of WeGotTickets, says ticketing companies may be the public-facing part of the business, but their cut of overall ticket sales is slim. WeGotTickets, for example, takes a maximum of 10%. It has to pay transaction charges on every ticket purchase and provide tools for event organisers, such as customer support and marketing, as well as handling refunds or rescheduled dates. \u201cOur revenue is our booking fee,\u201d says Kramer. \u201cWithout the booking fee, there is no independent ticket agent.\u201d While there have been legal changes in the UK whereby ticketing companies have to be fully transparent about precisely what extra costs \u2013 such as handling and transaction fees \u2013 are added to a ticket price, the business as a whole is not always transparent. There are shadowy shares of additional revenue split between ticket companies, acts and promoters. A megastar may negotiate part of the extra fees around tickets, classed as a rebate. A 2024 Which? study claimed such additional fees can add 25% to the price of tickets. There are also tales of acts securing a cut of venue bar takings and even the car parking. And then there is dynamic pricing, an issue that only affects acts getting blockbusting guarantees anyway. It has been justified by the live business as an attempt to neutralise price gouging on secondary sites. McAndrew feels dynamic pricing has a role in the industry, but that role must be conditional. \u201cIt has a place if it\u2019s limited and you\u2019re essentially serving a customer who is happy to pay a premium,\u201d such as corporate groups buying up VIP tickets for entertaining. Kramer, meanwhile, is fundamentally opposed to dynamic pricing. \u201cI don\u2019t think it belongs in live music at all,\u201d she asserts. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d Acts complaining about paltry payments from streaming, which followed on from the collapse of the more lucrative CD business, were instructed to play live more in order to make up for any shortfall in their income. But simply playing more shows is not a financial panacea \u2013 and there are only so many times they can play your local city or town before even the most loyal fans start to feel they are being squeezed. Ubiquity is the scourge of scarcity, the very thing live performance thrives on. Live\u2019s economics are proving to be as imbalanced as those of streaming. The top 1% make fortunes; everyone else is just getting by. In fact, argues Schroeder, \u201ctickets are underpriced generally. People don\u2019t understand the cost of touring to artists and how, in the vast majority of cases, people are losing money.\u201d Fans may feel concert tickets cost too much, but they often cost acts far more.",

        "bodyText": "It is debatable what effect celebrity endorsements have on voters, but candidates always welcome them. Here are the highly contrasting groups of A-listers who have endorsed Kamala Harris and Donald Trump: Kamala Harris Beyonc\u00e9 The music megastar spoke at a Harris rally in her home town of Houston just days ago. To the 30,000-strong crowd, Beyonc\u00e9 said: \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity, I\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother \u2026 Imagine our daughters growing up seeing what\u2019s possible with no ceilings, no limitations. \u2026We must vote, and we need you.\u201d Taylor Swift The pop phenom endorsed the Democratic nominee just minutes after the presidential debate in September between Harris and Trump. In an Instagram post published to her 283 million followers, Swift said: \u201cI will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election \u2026 I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\u201d Bruce Springsteen At a Harris rally last month in Philadelphia, \u201cthe Boss\u201d performed his 1978 song The Promised Land and said: \u201cNow, I understand folks have different opinions about things, but this election is about a group of folks who want to fundamentally undermine our American way of life \u2026 On November 5, I\u2019m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \u2013 and I urge all of you who believe in the American dream to join me.\u201d Stevie Wonder The legendary singer endorsed Harris at the Democratic national convention (DNC), saying: \u201cThis is a moment to tell your children where you were and what you did. \u2026 When we stand between history\u2019s pain and tomorrow\u2019s promises, we must choose courage over complacency.\u201d The 74-year old also appeared in a Harris ad alongside the filmdirector Spike Lee. Willie Nelson Country-music original \u201coutlaw\u201d Nelson, 91, performed at Harris\u2019s Houston rally where Beyonc\u00e9 spoke. Wearing a colorful Harris-Walz shirt, Nelson rallied the crowd with: \u201cAre we ready to say Madam President?\u201d Oprah Winfrey The billionaire multimedia executive and former talkshow host was a star of the DNC. Winfrey, who previously endorsed Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, swooped in, saying: \u201cSoon, and very soon, we\u2019re going to be teaching our daughters and sons about how this child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, two idealistic, energetic immigrants \u2026 grew up to become the 47th president of the United States.\u201d Julia Roberts In a new ad last month, the enduring Hollywood A-lister urged the spouses of male supporters of Donald Trump to vote for Harris, saying: \u201cIn the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want and no one will ever know \u2026 Remember, what happens in the booth, stays in the booth. Vote Harris-Walz.\u201d Kerry Washington Washington once played the White House communications director on the ABC TV show Scandal. She campaigned for Harris last month in Wisconsin. \u201cYou here in Wisconsin have the capacity to save the soul of this country, to really stand between us and a man who has said that he wants to be a dictator on day one, to stand between us and a man who said he wants generals more like Hitler\u2019s generals,\u201d Washington said to a gathering of Black women. Julia Louis-Dreyfus The Veep star endorsed Harris by making a distinction between her fictional vice-presidential character, Selina Meyer, and Harris. Dreyfus said to MSNBC: \u201cNow, I do want to say one thing about the character I play on Veep\u2026 I play a very, shall we say, almost narcissistic, sociopathic, mega-maniacal type of person \u2026 I am not a Kamala Harris type. I am possibly much more like someone from the other party whose name I shall not even utter.\u201d Jennifer Lopez Jennifer Lopez took to the rally stage in Las Vegas on Thursday to endorse Harris. In a 13-minute speech, Lopez, who is Puerto Rican, railed against comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s racist remarks about Puerto Rico at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally last weekend in New York. She said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, it was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character \u2026 There is no candidate in the history of the presidency that is more qualified and there is no job that Kamala Harris can\u2019t do.\u201d Eminem The Detroit rapper and longtime critic of Donald Trump told a Harris rally in his home town: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution, of what people will do if you make your opinion known. I think Vice-President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld.\u201d Megan Thee Stallion An early endorser, the rapper spoke in Atlantain July, saying: \u201cI want to start off by saying: hotties for Harris.\u201d Performing a compilation of hit songs, the 29-year-old singer said: \u201cWe about to make history with the first female president, the first Black female president.\u201d Bad Bunny The Puerto Rican music star leapt on to Instagram straight after Hinchcliffe\u2019s racist remarks.He posted about Harris criticizing Trump over his handling of relief efforts after Hurricanes Irma and Maria that devastated the island territory in 2017, where she said: \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader.\u201d Samuel L Jackson Addressing a rally of more than 20,000 people in Atlanta last month, the Hollywood A-lister said that Harris was \u201crunning on a proven track record of fighting for the people, standing up to bullies, protecting the most vulnerable and taking on the toughest fights\u2026 That\u2019s the kind of president I can stand behind.\u201d Magic Johnson The former basketball star rallied for Harris in Flint, Michigan, saying: \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019ve known Kamala for over 20 years. Cookie [his wife] and I supported her run for attorney general back in the state of California, her run for senator, and now we support her as the vice-president but now the biggest moment for all of us, November 5, we have to do all we can to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.\u201d Usher The rapper said in Atlanta that he was endorsing Harris \u201cbecause she fights for everyone\u2019s rights, for freedom, and it doesn\u2019t matter where you [are] from \u2026 She has a vision for our country that includes everyone, a vision that supports small businesses, invests in our health, in our communities, and gives everyone a chance to get ahead.\u201d Lizzo Another Detroit native, the music star joined Harris there last month, jabbing at Trump\u2019s comment that if Harris wins, the \u201cwhole country will end up being like Detroit\u201d. Lizzo fired back: \u201cProud like Detroit; resilient like Detroit. We\u2019re talking about the same Detroit that innovated the auto industry and the music industry, so put some respect on Detroit\u2019s name.\u201d Tyler Perry The producer and actor endorsed Harris in Atlanta, Georgia, last month, saying: \u201cI stand here, full-throated, with my full chest, begging you, imploring you: let\u2019s get out and make Kamala Harris the 47th president of the United States.\u201d Perry also spoke of the exonerated Central Park Five, men whom Donald Trump once urged to be executed, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve watched him, from the Central Park Five to Project 2025 \u2026 and what I realized is that in this Donald Trump America, there is no dream that looks like me.\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger The Terminator actor and former Republican governor of California endorsed Harris just days ago, saying: \u201cI will always be an American before I am a Republican.\u201d He said that if Trump wins, \u201cit will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful\u201d. LeBron James The four-time NBA champion endorsed Kamala Harris just days ago by posting a video showing racist, anti-Hispanic comments made by both Trump and Hinchcliffe. In his caption, the Los Angeles Laker wrote: \u201cWhat are we even talking about here?? When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!\u201d Cardi B Cardi B, who previously defended Harris from political misogyny, spoke at her rally in Milwaukee on Friday. She revealed that she wasn\u2019t going to vote \u2013 until Harris leapt in. \u201cShe changed my mind completely. I did not have faith in any candidate until she joined the race,\u201d she said, adding of her own story: \u201cJust like Kamala Harris, I too have been the underdog. I\u2019ve been underestimated, my success belittled and discredited \u2026 Women have to work 10 times harder, perform 10 times better, and still, people question us, how we got to the top.\u201d She called Trump a business \u201chustler\u201d who doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve women deserve rights\u201d. Donald Trump Hulk Hogan The former wrestler who once endorsed Barack Obama has thrown his support behind Trump. Hogan told the Republican national convention that \u201cas an entertainer\u201d, he tried to stay detached from politics but he could \u201cno longer stay silent\u201d due to \u201ceverything that\u2019s happened to our country over the past four years\u201d, adding: \u201cWe never had it better than the Trump years.\u201d Elon Musk The world\u2019s richest man has been something of an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d, jumping up and down at Trump rallies and, allegedly illegally, handing out $1m checks to supporters. The owner of X, Tesla and SpaceX is donating $75m to America Pac, his pro-Trump political action committee. At one rally, Musk said: \u201cI\u2019m dark, gothic Maga\u201d \u2013 Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again slogan. Kid Rock In an interview with Rolling Stone in May, the singer expressed his support for Trump, saying: \u201cYou think I like Trump because he\u2019s a nice guy? \u2026 I\u2019m not electing the deacon of a church. That motherfucker likes to win. He likes to cheat in his fucking golf game. I want that guy on my team. I want the guy who goes: \u201cI\u2019m going to fight with you.\u201d Ye In February, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, who visited Trump in the Oval Office during his presidency, was asked by paparazzi whether he still supports Trump. The rapper, who endorsed Trump in 2016, said: \u201cYeah, of course, it\u2019s Trump all day.\u201d Jon Voight The 85-year-old actor, who was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2019 by Trump, has long expressed his support for the former president. \u201cI\u2019ve been the most outspoken supporter of Donald Trump in Hollywood,\u201d Voight said in an interview with Variety in July. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying he\u2019s the answer, the only answer,.\u201d Mel Gibson Last month, the Braveheart actor was asked by a camera operator about who he was voting for, and he replied that Trump was \u201ca good guess\u201d. He said of Harris: \u201cI know what it\u2019ll be like if we let her in. And that ain\u2019t good. Miserable track record. No policies to speak of. She\u2019s got the IQ of a fence post.\u201d Dr Phil The television personality Phil McGraw appeared at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally. He said: \u201cLord knows he doesn\u2019t need me to stand up for him. He\u2019s tough as an old army boot. He\u2019s got lots of enemies, different groups that are scared, and between them, they have impeached him, indicted him, raided him, railroaded him, shot him and sued him. And where is he? He is still standing.\u201d Dennis Quaid The actor campaigned for Trump in Coachella valley, California, last month. Quaid, who played Ronald Reagan in a recent eponymous biopic as well as Bill Clinton in the 2010 film The Special Relationship, said that Trump was \u201cmy favorite president of the 21st century\u201d. Roseanne Barr The comedian endorsed Trump by describing him in 2013 as someone who \u201cwraps his arms around us\u201d, as well as a \u201cmother bear\u201d. In April, Barr posted a skit online in which she appeared to mock E Jean Carroll, the writer whom Trump was found liable by a New York civil court of sexually abusing. In the skit, Barr pretended to accuse Joe Biden of raping her 26 years ago in Bergdorf Goodman, in a parody of Carroll\u2019s claim against Trump. Russell Brand In an episode of his Stay Free with Russell Brand podcast in June, the actor and comedian expressed his support for the former president by saying: \u201cThey act as if a vote for Donald Trump is almost like you\u2019re directly voting for Armageddon \u2026 But I\u2019m starting to think that no, a greater threat to democracy is this kind of technological feudalism, that tells you that it cares about you and that it\u2019s protecting vulnerable people, all the while increasing censorship, increasing the funding of wars, increasing the division between ordinary Americans.\u201d Buzz Aldrin The second man to walk on the moon, the 94-year old former astronaut announced his endorsement for Trump last month, saying: \u201cUnder the first Trump administration, I was impressed to see how human space exploration was elevated, made a policy of high importance again\u2026I believe the nation is best served by voting for Donald J Trump.\u201d",

        "headline": "Sounds like victory? Listening to this year\u2019s election-ready songs",
        "trailText": "Stevie Wonder, Stevie Nicks and Will.i.am are among those releasing political anthems in the lead-up to the election",
        "bodyText": "In an election that, at least according to the pre-voting polls, appears to be the tightest in modern American history, seemingly every semi-famous to famous person is trying to make a small dent of difference. Celebrities came out of the woodwork in the final weeks of the campaign to overwhelmingly endorse Kamala Harris; meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes\u2019s mother cheered on Donald Trump at the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 election-eve football game. Celebrity endorsements are, as I wrote over the weekend, a double-edged sword for Democrats, projecting at turns strength and advantage, at others elitism, desperation and ominously high levels of corniness and self-importance. Especially when the endorsements involve one celebrity advocacy avenue that falls mostly on the negative side: celebrity election songs. There hasn\u2019t been a wave of starry musical numbers for the election \u2013 no Imagine video equivalent for Harris, at least at the time of writing \u2013 but a handful of songs, generally from older artists aiming at older, somewhat online voters, that is missing the \u201cKamala IS brat\u201d zeitgeist. On Monday, Will.i.am released Yes She Can, an acoustic \u201cheartfelt anthem\u201d in support of Harris. In a black-and-white video, the rapper denounces Trump \u2013 \u201cPeople entertained by the predator / we used to be united in America / now we just divided in America\u201d \u2013 and encourages people to \u201cvote for your life / do it for your daughters and your sons and your wife\u201d in surface terms. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman then vote for your rights / and don\u2019t let them take away your rights,\u201d he says over footage of protests for reproductive rights outside the supreme court. The song is a spinoff, of sorts, to his even cringier Obama-era election single Yes We Can, featuring an extremely 2008 selection of celebrities \u2013 including Scarlett Johansson, John Legend, Common, Kate Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and One Tree Hill\u2019s Bryan Greenberg \u2013 singing over footage of Obama\u2019s signature campaign speech. Stevie Wonder, who has stumped alongside Harris, took a similarly over-earnest tack, emphasizing unity in a country where many see that as beyond the pale. The 74-year-old singer launched a 10-stop tour in the month running up to the election; the Sing Your Song! As We Fix Our Nation\u2019s Broken Heart tour called for \u201cjoy over anger, kindness over recrimination, peace over war\u201d and featured an original song, Can We Fix Our Nation\u2019s Broken Heart, that encouraged listening, compassion and coming together through difference. \u201c\u2019Cause if we listen to different thoughts and points of views / All my brothers and sisters, we don\u2019t have to lose humanity / We\u2019re family, so can we please / Fix our nation\u2019s broken heart?\u201d he sings. \u201cWe\u2019ve been floating alone in a dark and bitter cold / \u2019Cause there\u2019s a growing ocean of lies that we\u2019ve been told to tear us down / But what I\u2019ve found is with our truth, compassion, and love / We can fix our nation\u2019s broken heart.\u201d Parks and Recreation\u2019s Nick Offerman, by contrast, went in for the skewering. In August, the actor, who memorably portrayed a gun-toting libertarian on the NBC sitcom, released Proud to be a Kamala Man, a parody of Trump\u2019s beloved Lee Greenwood track God Bless the USA, in which he dismisses the former president as a \u201chalf-assed Putin wannabe\u201d and a \u201cfuckin\u2019 dick\u201d. Other artists have taken a more oblique but still obvious direction. Pearl Jam recently released a song called Wreckage that, according to Eddie Vedder, may or may not be about Donald Trump. (Lyrics like \u201cOh, visited by thoughts and not just in the night / That I no longer give a fuck who is wrong and who\u2019s right / This game of winner takes all and all means nothing left / Spoils go the victor and the other left for dead\u201d feel \u2026 apt.) As voters headed to the polls, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 perhaps the most high-profile celebrity endorsement for Kamala \u2013 released a music video, of sorts, for her Cowboy Carter track Bodyguard that saw her vamp up as Pamela Anderson in Baywatch and Barb Wire for Halloween, with a final image that just said: vote. All of these feel somewhere between self-congratulatory, superfluous, or too terminally earnest \u2013 it\u2019s tough to craft an anthem or a message for an election in which, for many, cynicism reigns supreme. Arguably the most effective election songs are ones that reference a specific issue or a too-easily forgotten past. REM, for one, released a new lyric video for their 1986 song I Believe that featured footage of the band\u2019s decades-old statements in favor of reproductive rights, gun control, voting rights and alternative energy sources. The video, posted a week before election day, included a message from frontman Michael Stipe: \u201cI believe the choices in this election could not be more stark or more important. Please vote and encourage everyone you know to do the same \u2013 that is how we win in 2024 and I believe we can do it!!!\u201d And at the end of September, Stevie Nicks released her track The Lighthouse, a rock-tinged tune she began developing in the immediate aftermath of the 2022 Dobbs decision overturning Roe v Wade, in an election where abortion access will be a defining issue. In the song, which Nicks said \u201cmay be the most important thing I ever do\u201d, the former Fleetwood Mac singer calls for younger women to know their history, and fight for their rights: \u201cI want to teach them to fight / I want to tell them this has happened before, don\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d she sings. \u201cThey\u2019ll take your soul, take your power, unless you stand up, take it back / Try to see the future and get mad.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that almost all of these election tunes come from older artists, while younger ones \u2013 Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo \u2013 make their support known online, in the internet\u2019s preferred mode of authenticity that does not tip into full earnestness. Others, such as Chappell Roan and MUNA, have continued to draw attention to the war in Gaza \u2013 an issue on which Harris has struggled to court younger voters \u2013 by withholding their full-throated support for the vice-president. Not that election songs will, ultimately, make more of a difference than any other celebrity endorsement tactic, which are already dubiously effective. If anything, they\u2019re another way to kill time \u2013 to cringe, to laugh, maybe to feel \u2013 as we all wait to see what\u2019s next.
