        "bodyText": "The Weeknd has pushed the release of his new album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, because of the California wildfires, as well as cancelling a one-off performance at the city\u2019s Rose Bowl venue on 25 January \u201cout of respect and concern for the people of LA county\u201d. Hurry Up Tomorrow was due for release on 24 January. It will now arrive a week later on 31 January. \u201cThis city has always been a profound source of inspiration for me, and my thoughts are with everyone impacted during this difficult time,\u201d the musician, AKA Abel Tesfaye, said in a statement posted to Instagram. Hurry Up Tomorrow is the sixth album by the Weeknd, the final part of a trilogy alongside After Hours and Dawn FM \u2013 and purportedly the last album under Tesfaye\u2019s stage name. \u201cAs the Weeknd, I\u2019ve said everything I can say,\u201d Tesfaye told W magazine in 2023. \u201cI\u2019ll still make music, maybe as Abel, maybe as the Weeknd. But I still want to kill the Weeknd. And I will. Eventually. I\u2019m definitely trying to shed that skin and be reborn.\u201d The album is set to feature Playboi Carti, Anitta, Max Martin and Pharrell Williams among others. Tesfaye\u2019s focus now, he wrote in a statement, \u201cremains on supporting the recovery of these communities and aiding its incredible people as they rebuild\u201d. Tesfaye\u2019s XO Humanitarian Fund has previously donated $4.5m (\u00a33.7m) to hunger relief efforts in Gaza. As LA firefighters prepare for dangerous winds to return and further fan the disastrous wildfires, Beyonc\u00e9 has also delayed an announcement planned for 14 January. \u201cI continue to pray for healing and rebuilding for the families suffering from trauma and loss,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are so blessed to have brave first responders who continue to work tirelessly to protect the Los Angeles community.\u201d The musician called for people to join her BeyGood foundation in supporting the victims of the fire after it donated $2.5m to fire relief efforts. Meanwhile the Grammy awards ceremony, set to take place at LA\u2019s Crypto.com arena, will continue on 2 February as planned, Recording Academy Group CEO Harvey Mason Jr confirmed. \u201cThis year\u2019s show, however, will carry a renewed sense of purpose,\u201d said Mason Jr, \u201craising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honouring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d Universal Music Group posted that it would cancel all of the label\u2019s Grammy-related events, including artists showcases and parties, and redirect the resources to efforts to support those affected by the fires.",

        "trailText": "On a somewhat exhausting sixth album, Abel Tesfaye uses Brazilian funk, punishing house and lush 70s soul to press great songs into the service of rotten lyrics",
        "bodyText": "It takes precisely 20 seconds for the Weeknd\u2019s sixth album to imply that it might also be his last. \u201cAll I have is my legacy \u2026 I\u2019m all alone when it fades to black,\u201d Abel Tesfaye sings over a lush bed of synthesisers that quickly takes on the influence of 80s boogie. It\u2019s a line that feels very on brand. Hurry Up Tomorrow\u2019s release has been promoted with billboards declaring \u201cTHE END IS NEAR\u201d, social media posts in which Tesfaye has inferred the album is the final \u201cbeautiful chapter\u201d in his story and interviews during which he\u2019s suggested that a 2022 incident in which he lost his voice on stage was some kind of cosmic message: \u201cYou can end it now \u2026 when is the right time to leave if not at your peak?\u201d It is perhaps worth noting that the same was true of his last album more-or-less: 2022\u2019s Dawn FM was rich with end-times imagery, mentions of the afterlife and arrived accompanied by interviews in which Tesfaye announced his desire to \u201cremove the Weeknd from the world\u201d. A cynic might suggest that implying he\u2019s about to retire \u2013 or at least retire the Weeknd persona that he has inhabited for the last 13 years \u2013 now seems part of his release strategy. In fairness, it feels a lot more explicit this time around. One theory is that Tesfaye is more interested in pursuing a career in film, something viewers of The Idol, the abysmal drama series he co-wrote and starred in in 2023, might consider less of a career move than a terrible threat. Still, it\u2019s not a theory Hurry Up Tomorrow does much to dispel. It lasts as long as a movie \u2013 nearly 90 minutes \u2013 and it\u2019s rich in samples from soundtracks: Giorgio Moroder\u2019s score for Scarface, David Lynch\u2019s Eraserhead. It also comes accompanied by a full-length feature film, once more co-written by and starring Tesfaye (Oh, good). In addition, while there are umpteen covers featuring different artwork, the version that has been punted out to streaming services looks remarkably like a movie poster. A close up of Tesfaye\u2019s face, sweaty and grimacing, it\u2019s both striking and mysterious: he could be on stage, in agony or in the throes of passion. Equally, he could just be suffering the after-effects of last night\u2019s chicken phall. Or he could have been reading Hurry Up Tomorrow\u2019s lyrics, which are enough to bring anyone out in a sweaty grimace. There are moments when they slip into standard Weeknd mode, alternately predatory and injured \u2013 \u201cShe\u2019s addicted to the rush \u2026 she trust me with her life\u201d etc \u2013 but they are primarily concerned with telling you how awful it is being rich and famous. That\u2019s a tough sell at the best of times, although, in recent years, the charts have played host to a number of pop albums that have painted a very convincing picture of 21st-century celebrity\u2019s downside, Billie Eilish\u2019s Happier Than Ever and Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Guts among them. But a striking depiction of a panic attack on Baptized in Fear aside, Hurry Up Tomorrow really doesn\u2019t boast their lyrical depth or nuance. You\u2019re left feeling that Tesfaye deserves some kind of kudos just for singing a line as bad as \u201cin this penthouse prison, I\u2019m alone\u201d with a straight face; likewise the song in which he admonishes a lover for complaining with a petulant little stamp of \u201cyou know it\u2019s my opening night!\u201d or Reflections Laughing\u2019s wail: \u201cI\u2019m trapped inside a gilded cage.\u201d Indeed, it is occasionally so on the nose you wonder if it might not be treating the subject with a certain degree of knowing camp, as when Enjoy the Show features a voicemail message inquiring about the star\u2019s welfare, accompanied by a soundtrack of drinks being slurped, pills rattling, lungfuls of smoke being inhaled and suspicious sniffing. Arch or sincere, it becomes fairly exhausting over the course of an hour and half. It would be more exhausting still if the music on Hurry Up Tomorrow wasn\u2019t as great as it is. Tesfaye has described the album\u2019s sound as \u201cFrankenstein\u201d, and you sometimes see what he means. S\u00e3o Paulo jumps from Brazilian funk to a punishing house pulse midway through, Given Up on Me stitches together a lot of jarring fragments into an entirely gripping whole: a slowed-down, Auto-Tuned sample of Nina Simone\u2019s Wild Is the Wind; a sped up sliver of 70s soul; beatless, chopped-up piano chords. But even at its most straightforward, it\u2019s marked out by brilliantly turned melodies and fantastic production touches: the George Harrison-esque guitar that runs throughout Reflections Laughing; the rubbery bassline of I Can\u2019t Wait to Get There, the stew of sickly sounding electronics and lush 70s soul-inspired backing vocals on Big Sleep. It\u2019s a peculiar sensation: an album that floors you at the same time as it\u2019s driving you up the wall. It goes all out for a blockbuster ending, courtesy of two big ballads. Without a Warning has a certain end-credits quality, but it concludes with the sound of an audience screaming and cheering, as if demanding an encore. They duly get one with the blockbusting title track, which has a sparkling melody, a vaguely Purple Rain-ish grandeur and really does sound like a leave-taking: \u201cI\u2019m ready for the end \u2026 I have no more fights left to win.\u201d Off he goes, perhaps permanently, leaving behind an album that frequently presses great songs into the service of rotten lyrics. Suggesting that the Weeknd has run out of stuff to say but not impressive ways of saying itmanages to make you think his apparently imminent departure is a shame \u2013 and probably just as well.",

        "trailText": "Spotify\u2019s Billions Club tracks the world\u2019s most popular songs, but dozens of greats are nowhere to be found. From TikTok to TV soundtracks, we explore the forces shaping pop\u2019s new canon",
        "bodyText": "In 2011, Jacob Rubeck and Nick Rattigan were living in a basement in Reno, Nevada, and thinking about starting a band. One afternoon, Rubeck came up with a frisky Strokes-like guitar riff, Rattigan whipped up the melody and lyrics and Surf Curse\u2019s Freaks was born. \u201cWe wrote the song in like 30 minutes,\u201d the singer says. A catchy song about alienation and longing, Freaks was released in 2013 and became a raucous highlight of their live shows but didn\u2019t trouble the wider world until 2021, when it was discovered, out of the blue, by TikTok users. Its Spotify streams kept going up and up and up, until last March it passed a remarkable milestone. Unlike Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd or Prince, Surf Curse can claim membership of Spotify\u2019s Billions Club, the running playlist of every song to have achieved 1bn streams. They are not sure how to feel about that. \u201cThere is a lot of impostor syndrome,\u201d says Rattigan. \u201cIt\u2019s very surreal. I\u2019ve ignored it to the biggest extent that I could.\u201d For Rubeck: \u201cSometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. It feels good that a kid can see an indie-rock band from Reno, Nevada, be able to reach that \u2013 but it took a lot of weirdness to get to that point. Do you really deserve to be up there with these songs that have existed for the past 50 or 60 years?\u201d Recently, I became obsessed with the Billions Club playlist and the story it tells about the nature of popularity in the streaming era. Drake\u2019s One Dance became the first song to hit a billion streams on Spotify in October 2016, but Billions Club didn\u2019t launch until June 2021, with about 150 songs. Forbes called it music\u2019s \u201cnew class system\u201d and it remains fairly exclusive. On 16 January 2025, it featured 857 songs, 131 of which had ascended to the Two Billions Club and 17 to the Three Billions Club. The Four Billions Club is an intimate affair, comprising only the Weeknd\u2019s Blinding Lights and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You. Spotify has now made the clubs a marketing tool: earlier this month, Spotify launched a film of the inaugural Billions Club Live show with the Weeknd, to celebrate him becoming the first artist to rack up 25 entries (he has since added another). For most of the history of popular music, it was impossible to measure the popularity of songs over time. The Top 40 told you how singles were selling in a given week, but there was no way of measuring their staying power. Album sales illustrated longevity but not which tracks were getting the most plays. Classic rock and \u201cadult contemporary\u201d radio established a canon but only request shows were driven by listeners. It took the emergence of transparent streaming data in the 2010s to make clear, in real time, exactly which songs people around the world were listening to. Spotify is a facilitator rather than a bystander in this. Given that it champions certain music through opaque recommendation algorithms, editorial playlists and paid-for features that allow artists to make their music more visible, this newly forming canon is not exactly neutral. The highly public streaming metrics have their own problems \u2013 these stats are often quoted in toxic wars between stans or used to humiliate underperforming stars. But with Spotify the market leader in music streaming, these metrics are as close to a mirror of public taste as we are likely to get in an atomised online era. *** The Billions Club is now expanding exponentially, doubling in size over the past 18 months. As it grows, it will fill in some glaring omissions, but it is fascinatingly odd. Many of pop\u2019s most familiar songs \u2013 Imagine, Jolene, Blue Monday, Get Ur Freak On \u2013 have not made it yet. The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, U2 and Abba have one song apiece. Michael Jackson, whose Thriller is the biggest-selling album of all time, has just two, as does the golden age of Motown. Roll them all together and they still have fewer entries than Imagine Dragons. What a strange impression of pop\u2019s history you would glean from the Billions Club. Madonna, for example, would exist only as the second featured artist on the Weeknd\u2019s Popular; Stevie Wonder as no more than a Coolio sample; and Bob Dylan as simply the writer of an Adele hit. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jackson would appear less significant than the Swedish singer Zara Larsson; Radiohead and REM would mean less to the evolution of rock than M\u00e5neskin, Italy\u2019s winners of the 2021 Eurovision. \u201cWhen I see that a song like Bridge Over Troubled Water hasn\u2019t passed a billion, I feel bad,\u201d laughs Quebec singer\u2013songwriter Patrick Watson, whose Je Te Laisserai des Mots recently became the first French-language song to hit a billion. Written for the 2009 film M\u00e8res et Filles, it is a delicate constellation of piano, cello and French crooning. \u201cMy biggest songs are usually the ones I\u2019m not too crazy about,\u201d says Watson. \u201cI thought: nobody\u2019s going to listen to this. And I was right for years.\u201d Before it went viral on TikTok during the pandemic, it had just 1m streams. \u201cI can\u2019t swallow those numbers,\u201d Watson continues. \u201cI appreciate it, but it\u2019s hard to own it as an accomplishment.\u201d The main reason for these weird numbers is that Spotify\u2019s user base still skews relatively young, with more than three-quarters of the playlist released since the company\u2019s US launch in 2011. After the Weeknd, the most dominant artists are Ariana Grande, Drake, Bad Bunny and Justin Bieber. The album with the most entries (seven) is Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Sour. The leading veterans are Coldplay and Eminem with 12 songs each, spanning more than 20 years. (No song released before 2011 has been streamed more than Coldplay\u2019s Yellow.) Conversely, XXXTentacion, the Florida rapper who was killed in 2018 at the age of 20, released 10 billion-streamers in the space of 13 months. Appearances by Tones &amp; I, Gotye, and Lilly Wood and the Prick prove that the one-hit wonder is alive and well. So far, so predictable. Things get more interesting when songs predate streaming and have to rack up listeners decades after their chart heyday. The only three entries released before 1961 are Christmas songs, which are evergreen. But would you have guessed that the defining band of the 1960s, according to Spotify listeners, would be Creedence Clearwater Revival, with three of the decade\u2019s 13 entries? Or that the fourth biggest song of the 1990s would be the Goo Goo Dolls\u2019 anguished power ballad Iris? The Billions Club sometimes aligns with the traditional metrics of popularity. Its leading 20th-century songs are Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody( the UK\u2019s third biggest-selling single ever) and the Police\u2019s Every Breath You Take (officially the most-played song in radio history). Juggernaut albums such as Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Rumours (1977), Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Appetite for Destruction (1987) and Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Californication (1999) roll on, spawning three entries each. It is striking that 481 songs fall between three and four minutes long, the time-honoured radio sweet spot. But younger listeners process the past in chaotic ways, scrambling chronology and context. Rock (with a marked American bias) is surprisingly enduring, from AC/DC to nu-metal; turn-of-the-millennium pop-rock hits such as Smash Mouth\u2019s All Star and Jimmy Eat World\u2019s The Middle sit alongside uncharacteristic US breakthroughs from Radiohead (Creep) and Blur (Song 2). However, many of pop\u2019s biggest unit-shifters fall short when detached from their historical moment: Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?, Candle in the Wind \u201997, (Everything I Do) I Do It for You, My Heart Will Go On, I Just Called to Say I Love You, I\u2019ll Be Missing You, Blurred Lines. None of them is as popular as All I Want by Ireland\u2019s Kodaline, which reached No 67 in 2013. *** Like any music platform \u2013 radio, MTV \u2013 Spotify\u2019s systemic preferences can be exploited by artists. In contrasting ways, grabby two-minute rap songs and the \u201cmuted, mid-tempo and melancholy\u201d utilitarian background music that Spotify critic Liz Pelly calls Spotifycore both target distracted online listeners. But this doesn\u2019t yet register at the level of the Billions Club: whenever I tripped across a name I had never heard of, there turned out to be a real-world reason for its placement. One is that global listening figures capture the biggest regional hits, especially Spanish-language songs. Gata Only, a reggaeton hit by Chile\u2019s FloyyMenor and Cris MJ, swept Latin America and continental Europe last summer without denting the UK Top 40. Another factor is shrewdly namechecked in Gata Only: \u201cthe rhythm of the TikTok\u201d. During the 2020\u201321 lockdown, the video sharing platform began incubating numerous surprising obsessions with songs old and new, completely divorced from the usual machinery of promotion and radio play. TikTok hits are added to Spotify\u2019s editorial playlists and picked up by its algorithm, accelerating a snowball effect. This explains such puzzling Billions Club members as young artists whose names read like fragments of automated passwords (d4vd, JVKE) and indie-rock records that took off years after release, including Lovers Rock by TV Girl (2014), Space Song by Beach House (2015) and Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (2017). The time lag can be disorienting. By the time the Walters\u2019 drowsy, bitter I Love You So (2014) went viral seven years later, the Chicago band had broken up and had to hastily reunite. Most artists cannot make a living from streaming and Spotify\u2019s publicly visible tally of their streaming numbers can be dispiriting. For members of the streaming economy\u2019s underpaid middle class, a billion-streamer is therefore akin to a winning lottery ticket. The virality of Surf Curse\u2019s Freaks led to their first major-label deal and a financial windfall. \u201cIt\u2019s dark magic,\u201d says Rattigan. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty lucky we got the whole song to trend. Some people only have 15 seconds.\u201d He has an old-fashioned indie-rock suspicion of gaming the system. \u201cOne reason why these songs from 10 years ago hold so much weight is they were created out of a complete lack of awareness that they could be in that stratosphere.\u201d Songs erupt on TikTok because they are useful, whether structurally (a dramatic beat drop facilitates video edits) or emotionally. The platform may be new but the fundamental appeal of indie songs by the likes of Cigarettes After Sex and Beach House would be recognised by fans of doo-wop or girl groups more than 60 years ago. Like Radiohead\u2019s Creep or Noah Kahan\u2019s morose Stick Season, the UK\u2019s biggest song of 2024, they are soundtracks to teenage crushes and breakups, charged with the tuneful desperation of the unloved. My daughter told me she had cried to most of them. \u201cThe reason these songs are popular is they make people feel something,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople love to be sad. And when they\u2019re sad they don\u2019t want to feel alone.\u201d One of her go-to heartbreakers is Watson\u2019s billion-streamer, which has become a kind of emotional Esperanto, suitable for all manner of hard times. \u201cDuring Covid I think people needed something that was simple and comforting,\u201d Watson says. \u201cThere\u2019s no bells and whistles.\u201d The absence of context, while unhelpful in promoting his other material, has empowered this song. \u201cA lot of music comes with the musician\u2019s face on a billboard. Maybe this is like a person who doesn\u2019t really exist is singing to people.\u201d Watson\u2019s second-biggest song, To Build a Home (with the Cinematic Orchestra), was popularised by TV and movie syncs, another key driver of virality. Neither Kate Bush nor the Clash would be in the Billions Club without Stranger Things. Florence + the Machine\u2019s Dog Days Are Over owes its place to Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy, and reruns of Friends helped make With or Without You U2\u2019s solitary entry. The Netflix show 13 Reasons Why catapulted four songs into the elite \u2013 Lord Huron\u2019s doleful folk-rock reverie The Night We Met now somehow has more streams than Mr Brightside or Wonderwall. To return to the Goo Goo Dolls\u2019 Iris, its success turns out to be down to a bunch of factors: this melodrama of unrequited love was written for the Nicolas Cage movie City of Angels, hammered by radio in 1998, revived by The X Factor in 2011, discovered by TikTok in 2021, then prominently featured in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine last year. Mystery solved. Yet there remains something pleasingly inscrutable about mega-popularity. A song might be propelled by a TikTok craze or a TV sync, then put into heavy rotation by Spotify\u2019s recommendation machine, but it cannot enter the rarefied realm of billions unless vast numbers of people genuinely want to hear it over and over again. \u201cI\u2019ve realised that a good song is a good song,\u201d says Rubeck. \u201cThe earworm still exists.\u201d Watson, meanwhile, regularly hears from people who tell him that Je Te Laisserai des Mots helped them through hard times. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to participate in people\u2019s lives on such a large scale,\u201d he says. \u201cThose are the things I keep. The rest doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on 20 January to remove an incorrect data point regarding Wet Wet Wet.",

        "trailText": "Music and film stars celebrate late entertainment icon, with Wonder saying \u2018Quincy should remembered as one of God\u2019s greatest gifts to the world\u2019<br><br>",
        "bodyText": "Stars including Will Smith, Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder have paid tribute to Quincy Jones, who died this week aged 91. Following a career as a producer, multi-instrumentalist, conductor as well as a film producer, in 1990 Jones produced the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which gave Smith his first ever acting role. Jones brokered the casting in an impromptu audition by Smith \u2013 then known purely as a rapper \u2013 to NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff at a party at Jones\u2019s home, with a contract drawn up that night. \u201cQuincy Jones is the true definition of a mentor, a father and a friend,\u201d Smith wrote on Instagram. \u201cHe pointed me toward the greatest parts of myself. He defended me. He nurtured me. He encouraged me. He inspired me. He checked me when he needed to. He let me use his wings until mine were strong enough to fly.\u201d The sitcom was a huge success, running for 148 episodes across six seasons until 1996. It was a launchpad for Smith as a leading man in Hollywood, ahead of hit films such as Independence Day, Men in Black and Hitch. Winfrey also acknowledged Jones\u2019s hand in her career, after he recommended her for her first acting role in The Color Purple, which he co-produced and wrote the music for. \u201cMy life changed forever for the better after meeting him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI had never experienced, nor have since, anyone whose heart was so filled with love. He walked around with his heart wide open, and he treated everybody as if they were the most important person he\u2019d ever met. He was the Light. No shadows. He was love lived out loud in human form and he was the first person I ever loved unconditionally.\u201d In a long tribute speaking to Rolling Stone, Wonder said: \u201cHe\u2019s touched every single genre. It brings tears to my heart to think about how and where he came from and to know that he was able to grow through all of it. When I look at life every day and I think about how ignorant and irresponsible that people who don\u2019t get it can be, I\u2019m motivated to continue to talk about life, sing about it, and write about it, because that\u2019s what Quincy did. He connected with people who had those great talents, and he was able to bring out of them the best \u2026 Quincy should remembered as one of God\u2019s greatest gifts to the world.\u201d Other stars adding their tributes to Jones include Paul McCartney, who worked with Jones on the Michael Jackson duet The Girl Is Mine, from Thriller. McCartney said Jones had \u201ca twinkle in his eye and had a very positive, loving spirit which infected everyone who knew him \u2026 His long career stretches back to the early days when he was a trumpet player, then a band leader, then a producer of many great records. But it is as a friend I would like to remember him.\u201d The Weeknd simply described him as \u201cThe Reason\u201d, with another post saying: \u201cMy fans know how important Quincy was to the fabric of my music \u2026 Let\u2019s celebrate his life today.\u201d Elton John wrote: \u201cNobody had a career as incredible as Quincy Jones. He played with the best and he produced the best. What a guy. Loved him.\u201d Lenny Kravitz wrote: \u201cWhat a life. What an expression of authenticity. What a teacher. I am humbled that I was given the gift of your openness and friendship.\u201d Earlier tributes came from the likes of Joe Biden, who called him a \u201cmusical genius who transformed the soul of America \u2013 one beat, one rhythm, and one rhyme at a time \u2026 Quincy Jones solidified Black culture as American culture\u201d. Barack Obama also celebrated his life and work, additionally acknowledging how \u201cQuincy paved the way for generations of Black executives to leave their mark on the entertainment business\u201d.",
