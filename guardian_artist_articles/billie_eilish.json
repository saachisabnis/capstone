        "bodyText": "Where do you go as a pop star when you\u2019ve already hit the top? Maybe you flame out and move to Vegas. Maybe you launch a billion-dollar makeup line and never perform again. Maybe you re-record all your hits, take the world\u2019s biggest victory lap and break a seismological record. If you\u2019re Billie Eilish, you burrow deeper. You continue transcribing the deadening thrum of fame, the banality and brutality of public opinion. You keep excavating all your quivering neuroses until you\u2019re in a crater of your own creation. Or \u2013 as on the cover of Eilish\u2019s 2024 album Hit Me Hard and Soft \u2013 you\u2019re submerged in a bottomless well, grasping for the surface. Not that those anxieties stop you from putting on an arena spectacular. At Brisbane\u2019s Entertainment Centre, the first stop on her Australian tour, Eilish moulds the room like putty. Often it feels like a cult gathering. Every second attendee is dressed in some variation of their idol\u2019s signature silhouette: tiny hat, giant shorts, wireframe glasses, sports jersey. Some have been camping outside for days in flimsy tents. Midway through, Eilish demands total silence for a rendition of her 2018 single When the Party\u2019s Over \u2013 and the 10,000-strong audience complies, bound in suspended animation for the better part of a minute. Later, during the lovelorn belter The Greatest, Eilish soars on a pedestal far into the air: a glorious new-age leader exorcising her heartache \u2013 and ours \u2013 to the firmament. The sheer rapture feels new for an artist who has often spoken about the tolls of performing. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise that I could make touring enjoyable,\u201d Eilish said in a Vogue profile last year. \u201cI just was very lonely for many years, and I\u2019m not interested in that any more. I want to enjoy the show.\u201d Enjoy she does. Frequently, she breaks into a sprint around her figure eight stage, circling her live band in infinite loops. This is her first tour without her brother and longtime producer, Finneas, though his absence \u2013 with apologies \u2013 is hardly noticeable. Eilish swerves, vaults and ducks between hyaline screens that partially obscure her figure, resisting the glare of the spotlight. At times she\u2019s a blur of splayed limbs \u2013 and then she picks up the camera, her face suddenly gargantuan and duplicated around the stadium. It\u2019s a canny cat-and-mouse game and a nod to the themes she has written about her entire career: the trapdoors of visibility, the futile dream of privacy. And her star has only continued to rise since she was last in Australia in 2022. Her doleful Barbie contribution What Was I Made For? made her the youngest person to win two Oscars (after her first victory for the Bond theme No Time to Die). Then came the blockbuster Birds of a Feather, a song about a self-immolating crush that now has more than 2bn streams on Spotify. As expected, both those tracks are lodestones on the setlist, rousing a crowd that\u2019s otherwise somewhat subdued \u2013 or \u201cpolite\u201d, as Eilish puts it euphemistically. (It\u2019s a Tuesday night; they might be forgiven.) Even so, there\u2019s no resisting the bawdy allure of Lunch, Eilish\u2019s sapphic provocation which has the entire audience \u2013 hilariously \u2013 chanting each come-on at full volume. Equally invigorating is her verse on the Charli xcx collaboration Guess: a lascivious ode to lacy undergarments that turns the arena into a rave worthy of its colossal, squelching bass. Throughout, there are hints of Eilish\u2019s earlier trademarks. The macabre streak which underscored much of her debut record snakes through the show: the flash of a slithering alligator on screen, or the menacing mosquito synths of her early single Bury a Friend, amplified with literal pyrotechnics on stage. But this is a tour that makes room for evolution. Eilish\u2019s delivery on Guess \u2013 a seductive deadpan \u2013 is a far cry from the gauzy whisper on which she made her name. Elsewhere, on Hit Me Hard and Soft closer Blue, she snarls in a sinister baritone; halfway through L\u2019Amour De Ma Vie, a poison pen letter to a former flame, Eilish stretches her voice through Auto-Tune, elasticated and crackling over a dance breakdown. These tracks feel as stochastic as the weather. They enter noiselessly, then \u2013 buoyed by a rapid gust \u2013 they shudder and skyrocket. When you\u2019ve already hit the top, you just keep going. Billie Eilish is performing in Brisbane until 22 February, Sydney 24-28 February and Melbourne 4-8 March",

        "trailText": "The FireAid concert, scheduled to take place on 30 January, will benefit those who have been affected by California fires",
        "bodyText": "Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish are reported to be headlining this month\u2019s benefit concert to raise money for those affected by the California wildfires. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the lineup for the FireAid benefit concert also includes Jelly Roll, Lil Baby, Tate McRae and Gwen Stefani. Acts also listed yet not officially confirmed by TMZ include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day and Gracie Abrams with more names to be added. It\u2019s scheduled to take place on 30 January. The wildfires, which started earlier this month, have taken a devastating toll on California with a death toll of 25 and a further 38 missing. More than 12,000 structures have been either destroyed or damaged. FireAid was announced last week with partners Live Nation, AEG and the Azoff Company. The concert will take place at the Intuit Dome, the home venue of the Los Angeles Clippers. Proceeds will \u201cfocus on rebuilding infrastructure, supporting displaced families and advancing fire prevention technologies and strategies\u201d. The Eagles have already donated $2.5m towards the event. It is unclear yet if they will also be performing. Back in 2018, Lady Gaga worked with the Red Cross to deliver pizzas to those affected by wildfires after she was also forced to evacuate her Malibu home. Stefani also started a college-scholarship fund for students affected by wildfires back in 2007. Eilish has already spoken about this year\u2019s wildfires, urging her followers to help support a number of non-profits. \u201cWhile our family is safe, many of the people and communities we love have endured devastating loss,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cAltadena in particular is very close to our hearts ... it was the backyard of our childhoods, and the families, businesses, nonprofits, and musicians there remain cornerstones in our lives.\u201d Celebrities who have donated major sums toward relief efforts include Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Lee Curtis. \u201cThis is literally where I live \u2013 everything, the market I shop in, the schools my kids go to,\u201d she said. \u201cFriends, many, many, many, many, many friends, now have lost their homes.\u201d",

        "headline": "Over the moon: Billie Eilish sports 188-year-old Yorkshire wool brand at Grammys",
        "trailText": "The singer paid tribute to her home city wearing an LA Dodgers baseball cap crafted by English woollen mill Moon",
        "bodyText": "When Billie Eilish took to the stage at the 67th Grammy awards wearing a hat with the branding of the baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers, few would have noticed the much smaller logo on the side with two tiny union flags and the word \u201cMoon\u201d. But in a small town in West Yorkshire, Moon is a household name, as one of the last surviving woollen mills in the UK. The company prefers to say \u201cwe\u2019re one of a select few now\u201d, said Joe McCann, brand and product director at Moon, aiming to paint a less negative picture of what many people would think of as a dying trade. It is true that \u201csurviving\u201d might be a misnomer, given the company is thriving, shipping across the world to high-end clothing and interiors brands, including Ralph Lauren and the sports brand New Era, which collaborated with the 188-year-old textile company on Eilish\u2019s hat. McCann said the team were delighted to discover early on Monday morning that Moon had been beamed across the world during the 23-year-old singer\u2019s performance of her song Birds of a Feather. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any heads up but of course we spotted it immediately and were like \u2018Wow that\u2019s incredible\u2019,\u201d he said. Although Eilish failed to scoop a single gong during the music industry\u2019s top awards, the star sang live with a backdrop that paid tribute to her home city, Los Angeles, which was besieged by wildfires in January, killing 29 people, damaging or destroying more than 18,000 homes and forcing 200,000 people to evacuate. The performance, described as \u201cone of her most moving\u201d by critics, will make a great picture to add to the wall of celebrities at Moon\u2019s HQ, McCann said, which includes photographs of stars such as Liam Gallagher and Justin Bieber wearing clothing made from Moon fabric. The wall also features images of Downing Street and the EU summit in 2018, where leaders are pictured sitting on chairs made with fabric from the mill, as well as a picture of King Charles on a 2015 visit to the stone factory building built nearly 200 years ago where Moon still operates \u2013 although now with a number of modern extensions that have allowed it to keep up with growing demand. \u201cWe do everything from start to finish here in Guiseley,\u201d he said, referring to Moon\u2019s home, a small town that was once in the heart of the woollen industry, near Leeds and Bradford, just outside the Yorkshire Dales. Unlike some textile and clothing companies where some products are made in-house and others made overseas where production costs are lower, everything is produced in a labour-intensive process in Yorkshire, using wool from the UK, New Zealand and South Africa. Although the mill is a lot more hi-tech than it was in the Victorian era, when it was started by entrepreneur Abraham Moon, it does broadly the same thing \u2013 raw undyed wool goes in one end and luxury fabric comes out of the other. \u201cWe produce the yarn, we weave, and then we also finish, all on one site, which is very unique,\u201d said McCann. So Eilish\u2019s hat was made in this little Yorkshire town? \u201cYes, every component of that fabric would have been made here.\u201d He said the interest from fashion and sports labels has increased steadily, as they focus on quality and heritage. \u201cTweed is one of the first performance fabrics for sportswear,\u201d McCann said, although the company\u2019s aim \u201cis always to push things on a little bit, not be scared of change and embrace innovation\u201d. Sustainability is also a major factor, given wool is a natural fibre. He added: \u201cA cap like Billie is wearing of course will still be around for years to come and still look fantastic \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect product for the modern era.\u201d",

        "headline": "Billie Eilish, Sex Pistols and Beethoven\u2019s skull: music to listen out for in 2025",
        "trailText": "From stadium gigs by Linkin Park and Lana Del Rey to Central Cee\u2019s long-awaited debut album, there\u2019s plenty to look out for from pop\u2019s A-list \u2013 while in classical, there\u2019s a Festen opera and more",
        "bodyText": "Central Cee \u2013 Can\u2019t Rush Greatness Since the release of 2022\u2019s Doja and the following year\u2019s Sprinter, Central Cee has looked like UK rap\u2019s biggest hope, not least because he\u2019s achieved what no UK rapper has since Monie Love: genuine commercial success in the US. Both Doja and Sprinter went platinum there, and he\u2019s been tapped by J Cole and Ice Spice for feature slots on their hit singles. It means expectations run high for Can\u2019t Rush Greatness, a title that reflects this is his debut album, eight years after his first releases. \u2022 Released 24 January FKA twigs \u2013 Eusexua As usual, FKA twigs\u2019 first album in five years comes wrapped in a concept \u2013 Eusexua apparently suggests a state of ecstasy so intense that you transcend human form \u2013 while the singles so far released suggest a distinct dancefloor focus, inspired by the club scene of her adopted hometown of Prague. Given that it was co-produced by veteran DJ Sasha, the title track deals in trancey techno, while the Stargate collaboration Perfect Stranger throws a distinct UK garage influence (and huge pop chorus) into the mix, and Drums of Death offers dark-hued, potent electro. \u2022 Released 24 January Lady Blackbird Ever since Marley Munroe took the stage name Lady Blackbird \u2013 from the Beatles song she recorded in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder \u2013 her star has spiralled upwards. She\u2019s a fantastic vocalist, whose background in jazz doesn\u2019t preclude the influence of gospel, soul, folk and psychedelia. On her 2024 album, Slang Spirituals, she shifted away from the covers that dominated its predecessor, Black Acid Soul, and her self-penned material turned out to be great: that there\u2019s no shift in quality between her own songs and the album\u2019s solitary cover \u2013 an epic reworking of Bettye Swan\u2019s 70s soul classic When the Game Is Played On You \u2013 tells its own story. \u2022 Tour begins 29 January, London Palladium Jpegmafia The wilfully confrontational Jpegmafia exists on the fringes of hip-hop, his chaotic, head-spinning take on rap involving noise, punk, avant-garde electronica and \u2013 on his 2024 album I Lay Down My Life For You \u2013 170bpm Brazilian funk. It\u2019s an acquired taste, but he\u2019s exceptionally good at what he does, a skilled MC and an inveterate risk-taker with intriguing, if occasionally contradictory, things to say about race: he is, after all, a Black artist with a predominantly white audience. And the fact that he\u2019s playing a 1,500-capacity venue in London suggests his no-compromise approach is building a bigger fanbase than expected. \u2022 Tour begins 4 February, London Roundhouse Sam Fender \u2013 People Watching Fender cuts an anomalous figure in current British pop. The charts aren\u2019t exactly over-burdened with unashamedly political, working-class and Geordie-accented social-realist stadium rock: his biggest single, the triple-platinum title track of 2021\u2019s Seventeen Going Under, was a vfestival-rousing anthem about toxic masculinity, violence, mental illness and his unwell, debt-ridden mother\u2019s failure to access benefits from the DWP. It makes sense that he\u2019s hooked up with the War on Drugs\u2019 Adam Granduciel for his third album \u2013 the pair clearly share a love of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s heartland rock \u2013 and the tracks released so far feel more subtle and opaque than those that made Fender famous. \u2022 Released 21 Feburary Clairo Clairo first made her name with a succession of self-penned songs and homemade YouTube videos: Pretty Girl and Flaming Hot Cheetos more-or-less defined the latterday notion of bedroom pop. But for her third album, 2024\u2019s Charm, she collaborated with various luminaries from New York\u2019s celebrated Daptone label, crafting a slick, warm, sophisticated blend of soft rock, alt-pop and soul, with the occasional hint of Stereolab, that was one of the most appealing albums of the year. Following this brief tour, she\u2019s also playing at the BST Hyde Park show headlined by Sabrina Carpenter, alongside Beabadoobee. \u2022 Tour begins 13 March, London Eventim Apollo Steven Wilson \u2013 The Overview The slow but steady commercial rise of Steven Wilson\u2019s career \u2013 from frontman of 90s prog rock outliers Porcupine Tree to a string of Top 5 solo albums over the last 10 years \u2013 is fascinating: his music is complex and unashamedly cerebral, balancing electronics and post-punk influences with an audible love of Pink Floyd and Yes. The follow-up to 2023\u2019s acclaimed The Harmony Codex sounds like a full-blooded return to prog territory: two side-long tracks, based around a concept involving the transformative effect reported by astronauts who\u2019ve seen Earth from space. \u2022 Released 14 March Tyler, the Creator Once forced to cancel a UK tour after former home secretary Theresa May banned him from entering the country, Tyler, the Creator has become one of hip-hop\u2019s most deep and expansive artists. His most recent album, Chromakopia, is an eclectic and hugely impressive exploration of memory, adulthood, celebrity and identity, and his first UK tour in five years comes after a spectacular headlining slot at last April\u2019s Coachella, with support from Paris Texas, and Lil Yachty. \u2022 Tour begins 17 May, Birmingham Utilita Arena Lana Del Rey \u2013 The Right Person Will Stay The pivot towards country music was one of US pop\u2019s more intriguing trends in 2024, involving everyone from Beyonc\u00e9 to Post Malone and Dua Lipa, and making stars of Shaboozey and Dasha. That Lana Del Rey\u2019s forthcoming album continues the trend makes sense: \u201cAll my albums are somewhat rooted in Americana,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything, it will just be a little lighter lyrically, and more pointed in a classic country, American, or Southern Gothic production.\u201d It\u2019s not a huge leap to imagine her dramatic, storytelling songs about bad boyfriends and worse luck bedecked with acoustic guitars and pedal steel: an interesting prospect. She\u2019s also scaling up to UK and Irish stadiums on a six-date summer tour. \u2022 Released 21 May; tour begins 23 June, Cardiff Principality Stadium Linkin Park Two huge gigs this summer from major figures in what was once called nu-metal: Deftones take over Crystal Palace Park on 29 July \u2013 supported by Weezer \u2013 while Linkin Park bring their reconstituted line-up, with vocalist Emily Armstrong replacing the late Chester Bennington, to Wembley Stadium for a one-off show. Recruiting Armstrong was a gamble, but last year\u2019s acclaimed album From Zero, preceded by a Top 5 single, suggests it has paid off. Support comes from both sides of their rap-rock blend: fast-rising metal band Spiritbox alongside the aforementioned Jpegmafia, reaffirming Linkin Park\u2019s longstanding good taste in hip-hop. \u2022 28 June, London Wembley Stadium Fontaines DC Who could fail to be cheered by Fontaines DC\u2019s ongoing ascension? They\u2019ve got bigger while sticking to their own idiosyncratic path and declining to repeat themselves, shifting from clipped punk to the more expansive,poppy sound of last year\u2019s album Romance. If the latter was more straightforwardly melodic, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its follow-up will sound the same. Still, its critical acclaim and commercial success has led to the band\u2019s biggest shows to date: vast outdoor shows in Newcastle, Cardiff, Manchester and London. \u2022 Tour begins 5 July, Finsbury Park, London Billie Eilish It\u2019s a hugely impressive feat to impact on a tween/teenage audience quite as dramatically as Billie Eilish did in 2017, but it\u2019s quite another thing to hang on to that audience: pop music moves fast, teenagers grow up, tastes change, and yet Eilish\u2019s third album Hit Me Hard And Soft was one of 2024\u2019s critical and commercial smashes. It boldly shifted direction yet again \u2013 subtle, enigmatic and experimental \u2013 while spawning one of the year\u2019s biggest singles, Birds of a Feather: 1.6bn streams on Spotify alone, plus three separate Grammy nominations. These huge shows should be a riot. \u2022 Tour begins 7 July, Glasgow OVO Hydro Coldplay Coldplay\u2019s last two albums have been the lowest-selling of their career \u2013 merely shifting hundreds of thousands rather than millions \u2013 but they\u2019ve never been a bigger live act: this tour contains a staggering 10 consecutive nights at Wembley Stadium. Whether one thinks their pivot towards Max Martin-produced pop is a pragmatic response to shifts in musical climate or a faintly desperate attempt to court a younger audience, their live shows have become increasingly incredible: eye-popping, hit-stuffed exercises in relentless visual maximalism that\u2019s both infectiously euphoric and a little overwhelming. \u2022 Tour begins 18 August, Hull Craven Park Stadium Sex Pistols ft Frank Carter It\u2019s obviously not the first time the Sex Pistols have had to manage without Johnny Rotten \u2013 for their 1978-79 run of hits everyone from Sid Vicious to Ronnie Biggs deputised for their absent frontman \u2013 but there\u2019s something strikingly bold about recruiting former Gallows singer Frank Carter. The band have been a heritage act since they reformed in 1996, but Carter \u2013 30 years younger than his bandmates \u2013 seems to have brought a fresh energy and rabble-rousing physicality to their repertoire and live shows. He doesn\u2019t try to sound like Rotten, nor, with his penchant for crowd-surfing and stage-diving, is he much like him on stage. It works unexpectedly well. \u2022 23 August, Margate Dreamland Jalen Ngonda Early in December, Jalen Ngonda\u2019s debut album Come Around and Love Me unexpectedly reappeared in the UK charts after 18 months: the US-born, UK-based singer had appeared on Later With Jools Holland and Graham Norton\u2019s chatshow, presumably finding himself a new audience in the process. That isn\u2019t, in itself, surprising: if you see Ngonda perform, you\u2019re immediately aware you\u2019re in the presence of the real deal: a powerful-but-subtle soul singer in the classic style \u2013 David Ruffin is an obvious comparison \u2013 equipped with a set of fabulously listenable songs. You can\u2019t imagine him not getting bigger over the course of 2025. \u2022 Tour begins 16 October, Newcastle City Hall Classical music and opera Love Life Opera North revives Kurt Weill\u2019s musical, first seen in 1948. With lyrics by Allan Jay Lerner and described as a \u201cvaudeville\u201d, it follows the fortunes of the Cooper family, as they travel through 150 years of American history. The Leeds production will be conducted by James Holmes and directed by Matthew Eberhardt, with Quirino de Lang and Stephanie Corley as the Coopers. \u2022 Grand Theatre, Leeds, 16-18 January Hush Kaija Saariaho\u2019s trumpet concerto, her final work completed just weeks before her death in June 2023, receives its UK premiere. Verneri Pohjola, for whom it was composed, is the soloist with Sakari Oramo and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, who frame it with the Adagio from Mahler\u2019s unfinished 10th Symphony, and Vaughan Williams\u2019 Toward the Unknown Region and The Lark Ascending. \u2022 Barbican, London, 24 January Boulez @ 100 The centenary of Pierre Boulez\u2019s birth is celebrated at the Barbican by the two London orchestras most closely associated with the great composer-conductor. At the end of January, Maxim Pascal conducts the London Symphony in a programme that pairs Debussy with Boulez and a handful of premieres, as well as a concert of his ensemble pieces, while in March the BBC Symphony\u2019s day-long tribute ends with a performance of his orchestral masterpiece, Pli Selon Pli. \u2022 Barbican, London, 26 &amp; 27 January, 30 March Philip Glass festival The Hall\u00e9 and the Royal Northern College of Music present three days of concerts devoted to the great American minimalist. Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo sings the If\u00e9 Songs and Robert Ames conducts his 11th Symphony, while Colin Currie conducts 1981\u2019s Glassworks and the score that Glass composed for Frans Lanting\u2019s multimedia symphony, Life: A Journey through Time. \u2022 Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 13-15 February Bruckner\u2019s Skull Maxim Emelyanychev and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra give the performances of a commission from the SCO\u2019s associate composer Jay Capperauld. It\u2019s inspired by Bruckner\u2019s obsession with the exhumed skulls of Beethoven and Schubert, which he touched and even kissed in front of astonished onlookers. \u2022 Easterbrook Hall, Dumfries, 19 February; Queen\u2019s Hall Edinburgh, 20 February; City Halls, Glasgow, 21 February Festen With a libretto by Lee Hall, Mark-Anthony Turnage\u2019s latest opera is based on Thomas Vinterberg\u2019s celebrated movie, a black comedy in which a family\u2019s grisly secrets are revealed at its patriarch\u2019s 60th birthday party. The premiere production is conducted by Edward Gardner and directed by Richard Jones, with a stellar cast led by Allan Clayton, St\u00e9phane Degout, Gerald Finley and Rosie Aldridge. \u2022 Royal Opera House, London, 11 to 27 February Peter Grimes Welsh National Opera continues its series of Britten operas with the best known of them all. Melly Still\u2019s production of Peter Grimes will feature Nicky Spence in the title role, with Sally Matthews as Ellen Orford, David Kempster as Balstrode, Dominic Sedgwick as Ned Keene and Sarah Connolly as Auntie; Thom\u00e1\u0161 Hanus conducts. \u2022 Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, 5, 8 &amp; 11 April, then touring to 7 June Multitudes The SBC\u2019s ambitious multimedia series promises \u201corchestral music reimagined for all the senses\u201d.

        "trailText": "Music A-listers from Dr Dre to Olivia Rodrigo perform at fundraising extravaganza FireAid at neighboring LA arenas",
        "bodyText": "Making my way through the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, it was clear that FireAid was set to be a different kind of musical extravaganza. Taking place simultaneously at both the state-of-the-art arena (which opened in August) and the longtime city staple the Kia Forum, the roster, which included everyone from Joni Mitchell to Peso Pluma, was announced in the wake of the devastating fires that struck the area earlier this month and broadcast around the world to raise funds and awareness, the atmosphere before showtime was neither celebratory nor subdued, striking a delicate balance to coalesce over a common love for Los Angeles and its ongoing strife. A red carpet where flashbulbs are usually popping was mostly quiet as a mouse, with photographers invariably checking their lenses; perhaps the stars in attendance knew it would be inept to have a fashion moment on such an occasion. Even inside the arena, the usual pre-concert buzz of boisterous mingling and drink sipping was missing. Kicking off at the Forum, Green Day opened the show; an apt choice to slowly rev up the proceedings considering the rockers exude that California pedigree (they\u2019re from the Bay Area, after all) before welcoming Los Angeles native Billie Eilish for a rendition of the band\u2019s 2019 song Last Night on Earth. Eilish would provide a bookend, helping start the proceedings here and then helping close them nearly six hours later with a set of her own alongside brother Finneas. And no, she didn\u2019t sing the Barbie song. To welcome the crowd, perennial master of ceremonies Billy Crystal took the stage. Poignantly missing was his usual black tie associated with his starry hosting gigs: tonight he flaunted a hoodie and knit cap, which Crystal said were all he wore after he was evacuated and his home was destroyed. After announcing a $1m donation from U2 (seemingly one of the only acts in music not on the roster), Crystal delivered an emotional speech comparing the death of his father as a young boy to this recent tragedy, and the healing power of laughter. Naturally he cracked, \u201cThis young girl came up to me, and said she understood my pain because she had lost TikTok for a day,\u201d Crystal said, before adding: \u201cWith your help around the country and here in the room, we\u2019ll laugh again, we\u2019re gonna listen to music again, and we will be OK.\u201d Volleying back and forth between the arenas, the roster was like hitting shuffle on a music nerd\u2019s eclectic playlist. Alanis Morissette, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Pink were all on hand busting out a mix of their biggest hits and covers, with the latter singer noting she\u2019ll have her feet down on the ground on this occasion, a wry nod to her normal high-flying wire routine. Sometimes the juxtaposition was fierce: Graham Nash delivered a rendition of his 1968 Hollies-era ballad Teach Your Children, while Anderson .Paak brought out Dr Dre and Sheila E for a mini hip-hop concert that naturally included Dre\u2019s 1995 collaboration with 2Pac, California Love. In fact, almost every California anthem one could think of was on full display at FireAid, perhaps save for Randy Newman\u2019s I Love LA. Inside the Intuit Dome, Katy Perry sang her pop confection California Gurls, as well as Roar and Rise, the latter flanked (at least momentarily) by the Pasadena Chorale. (Notably Perry skipped any songs from her most recent ill-received album 143). Meanwhile Jelly Roll, assisted by SoCal native Travis Barker on the drums, fashioned a rollicking spin on the 70s Bob Seger classic Hollywood Nights while the Red Hot Chili Peppers closed out the Kia Forum portion of the show with the longest set of the night and a spate of their own odes to the City of Angels with pitch-perfect renditions including Californication and Dani California. And proving the night wasn\u2019t too somber, Flea performed in nothing but underwear. Fellow 90s rock icons No Doubt, perhaps reliving their recent Coachella reunion, also took to the stage, though they curiously focused on a gender-split singalong to Just a Girl. Guitar geeks had to be happy, with appearances by John Mayer, Joan Jett, Slash and the surviving members of Nirvana. The latter band, who only get together for charity shows and one-offs, flaunted an array of frontwomen including Kim Gordon, St Vincent and drummer Dave Grohl\u2019s daughter Violet; however, their set stumbled a bit thanks to sound mix issues. Baby boomers and gen Z were also well represented with the likes of John Fogerty (79) and Rod Stewart (80) energetically commanding the stage, while Olivia Rodrigo (21) and Gracie Abrams (25) all flaunted their biggest hits; the crowds spreading the love equally among the generations. Despite the once-in-a-lifetime nature of the concert, as the night went on and midnight approached, the audience was getting listless. The father next to me, with two young girls, was nodding off. It was a school night after all, but it was clear promoters saved Lady Gaga, one of the night\u2019s major draws, for last. Sting, who performed as the audience inside the Intuit Dome started to chat among themselves, couldn\u2019t fully capture their attention. By 12.30 Stevie Wonder sang Love\u2019s in Need of Love Today, which he previously performed at a bevy of charity events including the America: A Tribute to Heroes concert in the days following 9/11, before Flea and Sting joined him for Higher Ground. Finally, Gaga appeared with dyed eyebrows and a black wig. Sitting at a piano, she performed a pair of A Star Is Born tracks: the earworm Always Remember Us This Way and Shallow, before surprising the audience with a new one. Written with fiance Michael Polansky, she said she crafted it \u201cjust for tonight\u201d, albeit it sounded more Broadway than the Gaga-pop she\u2019s known for. By the end of the night, it was lost how much money was raised; gone are the Jerry Lewis telethon days when a ticker showed the numbers climbing higher and higher. Perhaps the number was so big it could have discouraged additional donations. Regardless of the figure, FireAid proved the power of music and how a just cause can bring together polar opposites. If anything, here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s a harbinger for the future.",

        "trailText": "Stepping aside from her role as pop\u2019s conscience, Eilish looks inward to tell murky love stories on her third album, and returns to her teenage flirtations with the macabre",
        "bodyText": "As with Billie Eilish\u2019s last album, 2021\u2019s Happier Than Ever, Hit Me Hard and Soft opens with a state of the nation that reflects her personal experiences through the media funhouse mirror. \u201cPeople say I look happy / Just because I got skinny,\u201d she sings in a bittersweet voice as limpid, bluesy guitar rolls behind her. She wonders whether she\u2019s already past it (she turns 23 today, 18 December), considers the trap of celebrity and laments that she\u2019s just grist for the content mill: \u201cThe internet is hungry for the meanest kind of funny / And somebody\u2019s gotta feed it.\u201d Eilish has been pop\u2019s conscience \u2013 about body image, sexualisation, industry and relationship abuse, the environment \u2013 since her teens, a role she is incredibly good at but really shouldn\u2019t have to play. Then the song pivots, and Eilish addresses an ex, in a nightingale-like voice: \u201cI never did you wrong.\u201d Culpability in a breakup, and \u2013 as with the paradox in the album title \u2013 the impossibility of identifying the villain in a complex situation are the murky themes of Eilish\u2019s third album: sometimes anguished, sometimes vindictive, always satisfyingly messy and candid. Rather than reflect generational angst (as her debut did) or the hell of teenage fame, Hit Me Hard and Soft is insular and intimate, right down to the fantastically prosaic lyric in Lunch \u2013 about her newfound desire to intimately acquaint herself with the fairer sex \u2013 where she\u2019s \u201cpullin\u2019 up a chair\u201d and \u201cputtin\u2019 up my hair\u201d as she prepares to get stuck in. Lunch is an apt title: desire nourishes and depletes across these 10 songs, and by ragged epic The Greatest (as raw as any Sharon Van Etten rager), Eilish wails in frustration about \u201cAll the times I waited / For you to want me naked\u201d, recriminating herself and her estranged lover from breath to breath. Those shifting power balances also play out in the arrangements, which, as with most of Eilish and her producer brother Finneas\u2019s work, stand apart from much of the rest of pop. The processed guitar and grinding electro of Lunch channel the indie-sleaze years of Eilish\u2019s infancy, the tightness of the sound mirroring the hyper-vigilance of a crush; at the end, her voice fractures, corroded by obsession. In the staticky, aquatic funk of Chihiro, her indignant falsetto about her love being taken from her is steadily sandblasted into oblivion by buzzing synths that billow into an alarm. By the album\u2019s second half, the songs themselves often have a split personality. L\u2019Amour de Ma Vie starts out sounding beatific and nonchalant as Eilish reveals to \u201cthe love of my life\u201d that they were no such thing, only for the track to shift and betray her breezy callousness as cover for a gaping wound: \u201cYou were so mediocre!\u201d she blurts, her dehumanised Auto-Tune piercing an icy Weeknd-like landscape. Bittersuite slips between lilting reggae, phasing synth clouds and chintzy bossa nova, and Eilish sings in a crushed mutter about the stew of jealousy and false idealisation that would make two would-be lovers a volatile proposition to be avoided at all costs. Even moments that appear more straightforwardly sweet are nothing of the sort. Birds of a Feather sounds both coy and forward, a euphoric devotional that spills over with feeling and could easily have soundtracked the climactic scene of a big 80s teen movie. Eilish sings that she wants her lover to stay, but her come-ons are couched in tricky double negatives \u2013 \u201cI said I\u2019d never think I wasn\u2019t better alone\u201d \u2013 and she\u2019s got one eye on the end, whether of the romance or a more morbid conclusion. \u201cIt might not be long, but baby, I / I\u2019ll love you \u2019til the day that I die,\u201d she rhapsodises. The warped fairground music of The Diner tells a love story from the perspective of a stalker, a figure Eilish knows well. Eilish has said that after the identity crisis of Happier Than Ever \u2013 when she bleached her hair blonde and wore a corset on the cover of Vogue \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft is a return to \u201cmy youth and who I was as a kid\u201d. You hear it in her relish as she flirts with the macabre again, and in the stealthy acoustic-driven power ballad Wildflower, seemingly about a love triangle in which everyone hurt and got hurt. \u201cDid I cross the line?\u201d Eilish wonders. Maybe she\u2019s the bad guy after all.",

        "trailText": "Global chart dominated by US acts including Benson Boone, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Sabrina Carpenter, with K-pop bands also strong",
        "bodyText": "British pop stars have failed to reach the worldwide annual charts of the year\u2019s Top 10 biggest singles and albums for the first time in more than two decades. In 2022, UK acts such as Harry Styles and Glass Animals made up seven of the 20 entries in the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) list. This year, the leading UK act was producer and singer Artemas, for I Like the Way You Kiss Me. British stars such as Charli xcx \u2013 arguably the most conversation-dominating UK act of 2024, with her album Brat \u2013 Dua Lipa and Coldplay did not feature. It is the first time since 2003 that a UK act hasn\u2019t featured in either the singles or albums list. The No 1 song globally was Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, and the No 1 album globally was The Tortured Poets Department by Taylor Swift. K-pop boybands dominated the albums list, with two entries from Seventeen (Spill the Feels at No 6 and 17 Is Right Here at No 8), along with Enhypen (Romance: Untold at No 4) and Stray Kids (ATE at No 10). The remainder of the list came from US superstars: Hit Me Hard and Soft by Billie Eilish (No 2), Short n\u2019 Sweet by Sabrina Carpenter (No 3), SOS by SZA (No 5), One Thing at a Time by Morgan Wallen (No 7) and Stick Season by Noah Kahan (No 9). In the singles chart, only Irish songwriter Hozier, with Too Sweet at No 6, deviated from the otherwise total US dominance of the list, which spanned pop (Carpenter\u2019s Espresso at No 2) to rap-country (Post Malone and Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help at No 7) and a five-year-old song by Swift, Cruel Summer, at No 9. The insistence of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s blockbuster Drake diss track, Not Like Us, was confirmed as it appeared at No 8. Jo Twist, chief executive of British record industry body the BPI, told the BBC: \u201cBritish artists may have enjoyed stronger years on the international stage, which perhaps isn\u2019t surprising given some of our biggest names were not in cycle in 2024. \u201cThere was still plenty to be excited about, as a new generation announced itself \u2013 not least Charli xcx, who enjoyed a breakthrough year globally, alongside international chart success for emerging artists such as Jordan Adetunji, Artemas and Good Neighbours, while the likes of Lola Young and Myles Smith are now rapidly building an international following.\u201d Twist said that it is \u201cundoubtedly becoming much harder to break talent in a hyper-competitive global music economy\u201d. The news comes ahead of the Brit awards this weekend, led by xcx with five nominations for Brat, followed by Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith with four.

        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink). Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best country solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 16 Carriages Jelly Roll \u2013 I Am Not Okay Kacey Musgraves \u2013 The Architect Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Chris Stapleton \u2013 It Takes a Woman In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "trailText": "Brat scores the British pop star five nominations, while male acts make up 53% of the overall field and mixed acts 12%",
        "bodyText": "Charli xcx leads this year\u2019s Brit awards with five nominations for her 2024-dominating record Brat \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s album of last year. With four nominations apiece, Dua Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith are close on the pop star\u2019s trail. xcx is nominated for album, artist and song of the year \u2013 the latter for the remix of Guess featuring Billie Eilish \u2013 and in the dance and pop genre categories. But despite xcx painting the British music industry\u2019s annual party a violent shade of lime green, women remain underrepresented in this year\u2019s nominations, accounting for 34.7% of the 98 slots. Male acts comprise more than half, at 53%, with mixed-gender acts and collaborations \u2013 including the Last Dinner Party \u2013 making up the remaining 12.3%. It\u2019s a noteworthy year for some vintage groups: the Beatles\u2019 AI-abetted Now and Then is up for best song, the group\u2019s first nomination since the very first Brit awards in 1977. (Prior to becoming an annual fixture in 1983, the first Brits marked Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s silver jubilee and 100 years since the invention of the phonograph, and honoured the preceding 25 years in music, seeing the Beatles earn three nominations.) And with three nominations for Songs of a Lost World \u2013 their first album since 2008 \u2013 the Cure score their first Brit nominations in more than 30 years in the categories for album of the year, group of the year and alt/rock act. At the newer end of the scale, Stargazing singer Smith is this year\u2019s Rising Star winner, tipped by the industry for major success, and is also nominated for new artist, song and pop act. The genre categories are assembled by the Brits voting academy and then voted for by members of the public via WhatsApp. Predictably, the category for hip-hop/grime/rap act features just one woman, Little Simz, alongside Central Cee, Dave, Ghetts and Stormzy. London jazz act Ezra Collective may also be set for a breakthrough year. The five-piece released their third album, Dance, No One\u2019s Watching, in September, after winning the 2023 Mercury prize for their second album. \u201cFrom a youth club to the Brit awards and beyond,\u201d they said in a statement. Some may raise eyebrows at a group active since 2016 being up for new artist \u2013 alongside last year\u2019s Mercury winners English Teacher, the Last Dinner Party, Myles Smith and former Brit School student Rachel Chinouriri \u2013 but the category parameters stipulate that acts must have had one Top 40 album or single in the eligibility period, but can\u2019t have had a Top 10 album or more than one Top 10 single, nor have had prior nominations for best artist, group or album. Despite middling reviews for her third album Radical Optimism \u2013 which spent just 19 weeks in the UK Top 100, compared to 220 for her 2020 record Future Nostalgia \u2013 Lipa is nominated for album of the year, artist of the year, song of the year (for Training Season) and pop act. Last year\u2019s major winner, Raye \u2013 who took home six prizes in 2024 \u2013 is up for R&amp;B act. \u201cI\u2019m still processing the ridiculousness that was last year!\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to watch Charli xcx clean up this year, she just deserves it so much.\u201d Some nascent comebacks also feature: Sam Fender is up for artist of the year and alt/rock act, despite only having released two singles from his forthcoming third album, People Watching, due in February; and Jade, of the on-hiatus band Little Mix, is up for song of the year (for Angel of My Dreams) and pop act. In the international categories, Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish have two nods apiece; Eilish also clocks a third nomination alongside xcx in the song category. \u201cThank you so much for the nominations and the recognition of my art,\u201d Roan said in a statement. \u201cThe UK has always shown me so much love and championed me through these past few years. It was one of the first places that Good Luck, Babe! blew up in, so this feels extra special.\u201d The awards for producer and songwriter of the year will be announced prior to the ceremony, which takes place on 1 March at the O2 Arena in London. Returning for the first time since 2021, Jack Whitehall reclaims hosting duties. No performers have yet been announced for the night.

        "bodyText": "Madonna has expressed outrage at the re-election of Donald Trump, describing him as \u201ca convicted felon, rapist, bigot\u201d. Writing on Instagram, she said: \u201cTrying to get my head around why a convicted felon, rapist, bigot was chosen to lead our country because he\u2019s good for the economy?\u201d She also posted a picture of a cake with the words \u201cFuck Trump\u201d etched in frosting along with the caption: \u201cStuffed my face with this cake last night!\u201d The singer has previously castigated Trump, saying at the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in January 2017, the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that she\u2019d thought \u201can awful lot about blowing up the White House\u201d. After a backlash among Trump supporters, she said: \u201cI do not promote violence and it\u2019s important people hear and understand my speech in its entirety rather than one phrase.\u201d Billie Eilish has also expressed dismay in the wake of Trump\u2019s election. She told a concert audience in Nashville on Wednesday: \u201cA person who is a \u2026 let\u2019s say convicted predator, let\u2019s say that \u2026 someone who hates women so, so deeply is about to be the president of the United States of America.\u201d She made the comments prior to a performance of TV, a 2022 song with lyrics referring to the removal of the federal right to abortion access, a decision made by supreme court justices installed during the Trump presidency: \u201cThe internet\u2019s gone wild watching movie stars on trial / While they\u2019re overturning Roe v Wade.\u201d Eilish added to the audience: \u201cI want you to know that you\u2019re safe with me and you\u2019re protected here and that you are safe in this room.\u201d Trump has not been criminally convicted of rape or predatory behaviour. However, in August 2023, a judge found in a civil claim that it was \u201csubstantially true\u201d that Trump raped journalist E Jean Carroll in an incident in late 1995 or early 1996. In 2022, Carroll had sued Trump for battery and defamation, with a jury finding him liable for sexual abuse. Trump countersued for defamation, but that lawsuit was dismissed. In May, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime. He was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, after he recorded reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen \u2013 who had paid hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels following her claims of an affair \u2013 as \u201clegal expenses\u201d. Trump\u2019s sentencing is currently scheduled for 26 November. Other musicians expressing outrage at a second Trump presidency include Jack White, who is suing the Trump campaign over allegedly unauthorised use of the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army. White wrote a screed on Instagram which reads in part: \u201cAmericans chose a known, obvious fascist and now America will get whatever this wannabe dictator wants to enact from here on in.\u201d Ariana Grande, Cardi B and Ethel Cain also lamented the election in its immediate aftermath, along with other entertainment figures such as John Cusack, Viola Davis and Jamie Lee Curtis. \u201cWe wake up and fight,\u201d Curtis wrote. \u201cFight for women and our children and their futures and fight against tyranny, one day at a time. One fight at a time. One protest at a time. That\u2019s what it means to be an American.\u201d",

        "trailText": "Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish are predicted to dominate Australia\u2019s biggest music poll come Saturday\u2019s countdown, with only two local acts tipped for top-10 spots \u2013 and just one original Australian song",
        "bodyText": "When it airs on Saturday, the 32nd Triple J Hottest 100 countdown will cap off a whirlwind year for the youth radio station. There have been soaring highs: just last weekend, the station marked its mammoth five decades on air with a celebration attended by former and current presenters \u2013 as well as Anthony Albanese, who lauded the \u201cextraordinary achievement\u201d. But over the past 12 months, Triple J has continued to wrestle with its greatest existential crisis: how to engage young audiences as listenership declines steadily. The station captured just 4.3% of broadcast audiences in 2023-2024, down from 4.6% the previous year and 5.5% before that \u2013 with the majority of listeners older than Triple J\u2019s core 18-24 demographic. \u201cUnder 25s all around the world are used to consuming entertainment on demand, curated for them by algorithms which ensure they only see and hear stuff they probably already like,\u201d said one record label manager who asked not to be named. In the last year, the station has also generated controversy with several high-profile departures. This will be the first Hottest 100 without the influence of Richard Kingsmill: the kingmaker and longest-serving Triple J presenter, who left the ABC in late 2023 in a rumoured redundancy after 35 years at the station. Several other senior staff also exited at a similar time as part of a restructure of Triple J intended to \u201cevolve\u201d its offerings. It may no longer be the anti-establishment bacchanalia of its earliest days, or the alternative tastemaker of its peak in the 2000s and 2010s. But the station\u2019s countdown still draws gargantuan voting numbers \u2013 over 2.3m last year \u2013 and sends group chats ablaze with predictions and arguments. So how is this year\u2019s Hottest 100 shaping up? Viral sensations Triple J\u2019s target audience may no longer be tuning into the wireless \u2013 but they are lapping up its online content: the station has increased its following on all social channels in the past year. One song in particular went gangbusters when it was posted last January: Royel Otis\u2019s Like a Version cover of Murder on the Dancefloor, which transposed Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s original into a sunny blast of indie rock that now has 7.5m views on Triple J\u2019s YouTube and 3.9m on the station\u2019s TikTok \u2013 plus an additional 14m TikTok views when the Australian band posted it to their own account. If Royel Otis\u2019s cover wins, it will be the second Like a Version to take out the countdown after The Wiggles\u2019 2021 rendition of Elephant by Tame Impala. It\u2019s more likely, though, that this year\u2019s top spot will go to another utterly inescapable earworm: Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck, Babe!, a deeply camp poison-pen letter to a former lover complete with coruscating synths and a soaring, karaoke-hostile chorus sung entirely in falsetto. Countdown prediction site 100 Warm Tunas currently has Roan tipped to win, with Royel Otis coming in behind. The site began scraping voting data from social media posts in 2016, though its accuracy has somewhat waned over the years as \u201cpeople are now posting less and less to Instagram \u2026 and instead favour more ephemeral means of sharing, like stories,\u201d says 100 Warm Tunas creator Nick Whyte. Even so, tipsters would do well to believe his predictions: Whyte has correctly picked three of the last five winners, and this year\u2019s data is even more promising. Good Luck, Babe! (Roan\u2019s only eligible song) appears in 27% of voting slips collected by 100 Warm Tunas and Murder on the Dancefloor in 21% \u2013 whereas Whyte says previous years\u2019 top contenders have sat closer to 18%. Pop and lock it It has been exactly a decade since the Taylor Swift debacle where fans started a voting campaign for the megastar\u2019s track Shake It Off \u2013 which was later disqualified from the countdown. The hubbub now seems curiously old-fashioned in the face of genre-agnostic audiences and a Triple J playlist that includes a healthy dose of pop. \u201cThe music in the Hottest 100 is more varied nowadays,\u201d says Triple J music director Nick Findlay. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more voters celebrate a much broader musical taste in general with their votes split across different artists and genres.\u201d To no surprise, the countdown will be inundated with songs from Charli xcx\u2019s Brat and its remix album, last year\u2019s pop phenomenon which saturated the world (and certain political campaigns) in radioactive green. The British dance doyenne is slated to appear eight times in the countdown according to 100 Warm Tunas, with two tracks in the top 10. Her highest ranker is Guess, a squelching, lascivious collaboration with Hottest 100 favourite Billie Eilish \u2013 who has placed in the top 10 four times in the last five years and will probably appear at the pointy end again with her lovesick declaration Birds of a Feather. Other pop stars likely to join the fray include Taylor Swift protege Gracie Abrams with That\u2019s So True, a motor-mouthed kiss-off to an ex that became a fan favourite on TikTok; Tove Lo, with her Dom Dolla collaboration Cave; and Addison Rae, whose swooning single Diet Pepsi catapulted her from TikTok influencer to bona fide pop insider last year. But what about the Australians? Sharp-eyed pundits may notice a lack of original Australian songs in this year\u2019s predicted top 10. Joining Chappell Roan, Royel Otis, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish in the top spots are Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us; British singer-songwriter Lola Young\u2019s snarling break-up anthem Messy; Irish punk act Fontaines DC\u2019s four-minute panic attack Starburster; DJ Fred Again\u2019s fleet-footed Places To Be ; and another Charli remix \u2013 Girl, So Confusing, with Lorde. Only one local track appears alongside them: One Bad Day, a howling plea for deliverance by Perth band Spacey Jane. Data from 100 Warm Tunas, though, does have a bevy of Australian peers clocking in just behind the top 10, including Dom Dolla, Amyl and the Sniffers, The Rions, G Flip \u2013 with a cover of Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer \u2013 and Hottest 100 mainstays Ball Park Music, who have appeared 13 times in the countdown to date. Australian music has suffered on Australian charts of late. In 2024, just five out of 100 songs on Aria\u2019s year-end charts were Australian \u2013 and the highest-ranking was Vance Joy\u2019s decade-old Riptide. Last year, the number of local songs in the Hottest 100 was the lowest it had been in 10 years, at 52 tracks. Findlay says Triple J does \u201cconsistently play well over 50% of Australian music every week\u201d \u2013 above its mandated quota of 40%. And, he says, \u201c8 out of the 10 most played artists on Triple J were all local acts\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s a sign of the times: a confluence of streaming domination and cultural cringe. Or maybe we just really loved Brat. Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 will be broadcast from midday on Saturday 25 January",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 is out in front with the nominations for the 67th Grammy awards in what promises to be another female-heavy year. The star has scored 11 nods for her country album Cowboy Carter with recognition in the country, pop and Americana categories. It\u2019s the biggest number of nominations she has received in a single year and she now holds the joint record of most-nominated artist ever alongside her husband, Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 is also the most awarded artist in Grammys history with 32 wins, yet has not won album of the year to date. In that category she faces competition from Andr\u00e9 3000, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Jacob Collier, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift. Following Beyonc\u00e9 with seven nominations each are Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish. Then with six each is Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. Breakout star Roan continues a highly successful year and will be one of the favourites in the new artist category alongside Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, Khruangbin, Raye, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims. The record of the year category contains The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2018Em, Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso, Charli xcx \u2013 360, Kendrick Lemar \u2013 Not Like Us, Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck Babe and Taylor Swift and Post Malone \u2013 Fortnight. The song of the year category includes Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy), Billie Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019s Die with a Smile, Taylor Swift and Post Malone\u2019s Fortnight, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck Babe, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Please Please Please and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2018Em. The dance categories also saw recognition for Justice, Troye Sivan and Disclosure while the rock categories were led by The Black Keys and Green Day. The controversial star Chris Brown, who was the subject of a new documentary detailing various allegations of abuse and sexual assault, was featured prominently in the R&amp;B categories alongside Muni Long and Lucky Daye. Lamar was the most-nominated rap artist and faces competition in those categories from Eminem and J Cole. Dolly Parton, Jimmy Carter and Barbra Streisand also feature in the unusual line-up for this year\u2019s audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais are featured in the comedy album line-up. The recording academy\u2019s CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, called music a \u201cpowerful force for good\u201d in his introduction to today\u2019s announcement. The awards are voted on by a body of 13,000 members. No new categories were added for the first time in four years. Earlier this year, Taylor Swift became the first artist to win album of the year for the fourth time, taking home the award for Midnights. The 67th Grammy awards will take place on 2 February 2025 with a host for the ceremony yet to be announced.",

        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",

        "bodyText": "A \u201cvery different\u201d Grammy awards will take place in Los Angeles this weekend, impacted by the recent wildfires that have affected California. The annual celebration of music, taking place at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday, will still feature a range of big-name performers but there will be a noticeable shift in purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical Grammy party atmosphere,\u201d said Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the Recording Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only \u2018the show must go on\u2019 but the show must provide a greater service. Of course, we\u2019re going to honor music, but our goal is to utilise music to make a difference.\u201d The week leading to the Grammys typically sees a string of major parties put on by record labels, but the majority have been cancelled in response to the fires, which have killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of structures. Money will instead be diverted to those in need. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\u201d Mason said. \u201cIt will honour some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d The annual tradition that will go ahead in Clive Davis\u2019s legendary gala, which takes place the night before. This year\u2019s event will also include a fundraising element. \u201cWe want to ensure that the evening will not only be a memorable night of music but will also provide impactful support for those very much in need,\u201d Davis said. This year\u2019s nominees are led by Beyonc\u00e9, whose country album Cowboy Carter brought her 11 nods, making her the most nominated artist ever alongside husband Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to win the award for album of the year and if she wins this weekend, she would be only the fourth Black woman to take it home. The star has been nominated for the award four times before. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d Jay-Z said last year on stage. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has already become the first solo Black female to top the country charts in the US and could make history if she wins in the country categories on Sunday. The singer, whose mother Tina Knowles lost a home in the fires, has donated $2.5m to relief efforts. In the category of album of the year, she faces competition from stars including Andr\u00e9 3000, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx and Taylor Swift, who won last year. Swift, who has now won 14 Grammys, has also donated to a number of wildfire funds. In an Instagram statement, urging others to also contribute, she wrote that it was \u201cheartbreaking to see the stories unfold\u201d. The singer has been confirmed to present an award on Sunday. The evening will be hosted by Trevor Noah and feature performances from multiple nominees Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter with a special tribute to the late Quincy Jones, featuring Stevie Wonder and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. \u201cIt\u2019s Grammy week,\u201d Roan wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \u201cI am very emo. My heart feels warm and fuzzy with all the support I have been given this past year. I hope you can understand that this has been incredible and scary and spiritual and confusing.\u201d The evening lands in the middle of an awards season that has seen delays and shifts as a result of the ongoing wildfires. The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and a tweaked ceremony will remove original song performances and spend more time trying to \u201cacknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires\u201d. The Critics Choice awards were also delayed until 7 February. This week also saw a benefit concert in Los Angeles with stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Joni Mitchell performing.",

        "trailText": "Smart, funny, moving and full of big tunes, the in-your-face masterpiece was the right album at the right time, striking a cultural nerve and defining a change in mindset",
        "bodyText": "In 2022, Charli xcx released Crash, an album that she claimed was a deliberate \u201csellout\u201d. An artist who had previously seemed hell-bent on singlehandedly dragging pop music into a more interesting, experimental space by sheer force of will \u2013 on her acclaimed 2017 mixtape Pop 2, she collaborated with Estonian \u201cpost-Soviet\u201d rappers, Brazilian drag queens and the extravagantly foul-mouthed underground artist CupcakKe \u2013 had apparently decided not to bother any more. She gamely presented Crash as another experiment in \u201cmaking a major-label album the way it\u2019s actually done\u201d and knowingly embracing \u201ceverything that the life of a pop figurehead has to offer in today\u2019s world \u2013 celebrity, obsession and global hits\u201d, but you somehow sensed her heart wasn\u2019t quite in it. Moreover, it didn\u2019t totally work \u2013 it was well reviewed and became Charli\u2019s first UK No 1 album, but didn\u2019t exactly produce \u201cglobal hits\u201d. What Charli subsequently described as a deadening experience lit a fire under its author: if playing the game was no fun, then why not do exactly as you please? Certainly, Charli xcx\u2019s sixth album turned out to be everything Crash wasn\u2019t, up to and including the defining pop album of the year. Instead of a sleeve featuring the singer in a bikini, as Crash did, Brat came wrapped in a blunt, lowercase rendering of the album\u2019s title against a sickly lime green: intended as a snub to the \u201cmisogynistic and boring\u201d assumption that a female artist should automatically appear on her own album cover, it turned out to be a masterstroke of branding far more pervasive than any glossy photo, even influencing the US presidential race. Its sound was brash and aggressive, early 00s London club music \u2013 electroclash, acid-y bloghouse, dubstep, maximalist rave synths \u2013 shot through a chattering, trebly hyperpop filter: \u201cClub classic but I still pop,\u201d as Von Dutch put it. It oozed self-possession and confidence, Brat seemed to swagger even as Charli confessed to insecurity or inadequacy, a cocktail of emotions that seemed to be at the album\u2019s centre: if everyone feels like this, you might as well own it. It felt fundamentally honest: instead of pop\u2019s usual broad-brushstroke self-help platitudes, there was something striking about the splurge of complex, vacillating feelings regarding motherhood on I Think About It All the Time, or the mixture of admiration and resentment on Mean Girls. Most importantly, it had a surfeit of fantastic songs: Apple, Everything Is Romantic, Club Classics, So I\u2019s heartbreaking eulogy to her late collaborator Sophie. Messy, obdurate and in your face, Brat\u2019s tone struck a genuine cultural nerve. Perhaps you could have seen that coming. Over the last couple of years, a nostalgic fascination with \u201cindie sleaze\u201d \u2013 grimy, sweaty looking images of early 00s hedonism and the music that soundtracked it \u2013 seemed to indicate a longing among gen Z for a rather less straitened, watchful, self-censoring mood than that of recent years. Brat was the right album at the right time, something that other pop stars \u2013 ordinarily more commercially successful than Charli xcx \u2013 recognised: Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and Lorde all appeared on the remix album Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat, the latter on a version of Girl, So Confusing, a song about Charli xcx\u2019s fraught relationship with \u2026 Lorde. Taylor Swift, meanwhile, was apparently so rattled by Brat\u2019s arrival that she suddenly released six different deluxe editions of her album The Tortured Poets Department in order to keep it from reaching No 1 in the UK. Whether Brat singlehandedly drags pop music into a more interesting, experimental space remains to be seen. But whether you view it as zeitgeist-capturing or zeitgeist-changing feels slightly beside the point. More important is that it does everything you might conceivably want a pop album to do: it\u2019s sharp and smart, funny and moving; it\u2019s experimental and danceable; it has big tunes and depth; it sounds like now. And it\u2019s the product of a pop artist declining to chase trends, and instead just being themselves. There\u2019s a lesson in there somewhere.",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight. I don\u2019t think she hates to say it at all. LS",

        "bodyText": "There was something different about the announcements on the Manchester tram network this week. Instead of the usual voice calling out Deansgate-Castlefield and St Peter\u2019s Square, passengers have been listening to Rita Ora warning: \u201cMake sure you plan your journey \u2013 it\u2019s gonna be busy!\u201d The pop star was in Manchester on Sunday to host the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs), one of the highlights of the global music calendar, at the city\u2019s Co-op Live Arena. Featuring performances from Shawn Mendes, Raye and the South African singer Tyla, this year was the first time the EMAs was held in Manchester \u2013 arguably England\u2019s music capital \u2013 having previously travelled to Glasgow, Liverpool, Belfast and Edinburgh, as well as three visits to London since it began in 1994. During the show Ora gave an emotional tribute to the One Direction singer Liam Payne, saying: \u201cLiam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew. He had the biggest heart and was always the first person to offer help in any way that he could. \u201cHe brought so much joy to every room he walked into and he left such a mark on the world.\u201d Taylor Swift led the nominations, making an appearance in seven categories and coming away with four awards, including best artist and best video for Fortnight, her duet with Post Malone. She has become the first musician to win best artist three times, ahead of two-time best artist winner Mendes, who picked up an award this year for best Canadian artist. Swift, whose Eras tour has been the most lucrative in music history, also saw off other top female artists in a female-dominated lineup, also featuring Charli XCX and Billie Eilish. Homegrown artists triumphed too, with Raye winning best UK artist, Liam Gallagher picking up best rock artist and Calvin Harris winning best electronic artist. Best song predictably went to the song of the summer, Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, beating Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2019Em, Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck, Babe! and We Can\u2019t Be Friends by Ariana Grande. Pet Shop Boys, who picked up the Pop Pioneer award for their 40 years in the music industry, also performed, alongside a local orchestra, the Manchester Camerata. The duo are the most successful in UK music history with Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe listed in the Guinness Book of Records, achieving 44 UK Top 30 singles, including 22 Top 10 hits and four No 1s, 15 UK Top 10 studio albums and sold-out shows in 63 countries. The hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes \u2013 with an unlikely connection to the north-west of England \u2013 took home a lifetime achievement award. The musician previously spoke of spending two summers with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d he told the BBC last year. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a white and a black person go [to school] together until I came here.\u201d Accepting the award, which was presented by the British rapper Little Simz, Rhymes said: \u201cThis is my first time here. I\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty-four years of professionally recording, this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels fucking incredible.\u201d The 12-time Grammy nominee thanked his mother, who he described as his best friend and hero. Rhymes also performed a medley of his greatest hits to the crowd of 23,500, at the UK\u2019s largest indoor music venue. Broadcast live to more than 150 countries across the world, the EMAs are watched closely by the music industry as they often give a hint of which artists are lined up for success at the Grammys. The EMAs were the last in a week-long series of events in Manchester under the umbrella of MTV music week. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said: \u201cFor a long time we\u2019ve been saying that Manchester is the UK\u2019s capital of music, with a rich musical heritage stretching back decades that has helped build a vibrant, diverse music scene that continues to flourish today. \u201cHaving the MTV EMAs, music week and some of the biggest names in pop music like Rita Ora in Manchester not only helps to strengthen our claim, but it also provides a huge boost to our music industry and the wider economy.\u201d",
