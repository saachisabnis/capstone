        "bodyText": "In 2017, Lady Gaga took on an unenviable task: filling in for Beyonc\u00e9, who dropped out of a Coachella headliner slot due to pregnancy. Gaga\u2019s replacement performance, in her country-tinged Joanne era \u2013 as usual, she was years ahead of the pop curve \u2013 more than sufficed; perhaps only Beyonc\u00e9 can hold a candle to her in terms of true-blue live performance ability, and she delivered the set of a consummate entertainer and generational talent. But Gaga felt that she had unfinished business. \u201cI\u2019ve had a vision I\u2019ve never been able to fully realize at Coachella for reasons beyond our control,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post announcing her return to the desert for another headliner slot this spring. \u201cI have been wanting to go back and do it right, and I am.\u201d Did she ever. Gaga, more than any other contemporary pop star, has approached pop as transmogrification, live performance like a hunter \u2013 the piercing gaze, transparent hunger and annihilating focus of an apex predator. And with Gagachella, as her fans have already termed a thesis statement of a set, she goes in for the kill. You knew from the minute she appeared in full deranged queen regalia, the head of a multi-story hoop skirt that opened to reveal a birdcage prison of backup dancers, that the vision was nigh. The nearly two-hour performance, covering 22 songs from her dance pop catalogue, joins Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s postponed Homecoming in the pantheon of groundbreaking Coachella headliner sets \u2013 a fully realized vision of a pop master, a testament to years of hard-earned experience at the highest level, and a banger dance party with production and delivery in a league above her peers. At 38, Gaga reigns as a monarch in pop music, a fact she wielded to stupefying effect on Friday evening to a crowd that extended far beyond any eye could see. \u201cWelcome to my house,\u201d she intoned before opener Bloody Mary \u2013 understatement of the month, as her house was the sprawling skeleton of a neoclassical opera house, her domain an arresting realm of elaborate make-believe. For the purpose of Mayhem, the new album that returns to her original principles of pounding volume, dirty synths, high theatrics and irresistible hooks, Gaga conjures an entire fantasy of witches and queens, a typically twisted, self-referential fairytale of literal dark and light told in five acts. Gagachella was notably not a full career retrospective \u2013 no tracks from Artpop, Joanne or Chromatica, with just A Star Is Born\u2019s Shallow as the lone representative of Gaga\u2019s decade-long pivot away from gritty, sticky music that makes you want to move. Yet it still felt comprehensive, all-encompassing, by seamlessly braiding her foundational texts \u2013 The Fame, Born This Way \u2013 with her latest one. Mayhem is easily Gaga\u2019s best album since Artpop, both a return to form and a hard-won study of warring personas contained in one self, pop music with sharp teeth and beastly desire. Ever the visionary and literalist, she rendered her internal strife as a court battle between a domineering queen in black and an innocent in white, with full wig changes from black bob to blond ringlets necessitating long, pulsating transitions that lavished attention on her army of backup dancers and, frankly, metal instrumentalists. Gagachella, too, marks a return to form \u2013 from the outset of her career, Gaga has treated pop music as possession, her spasmodic dance style like an exorcism, more refreshingly loose and instinctual than her peers. The Mother Monster\u2019s visions \u2013 a chess battle to the death (Poker Face), rage at fame sung to a skeleton (Perfect Celebrity), new Gaga strangled by 2009 VMAs Gaga in a zombie-filled grave (Disease, the concert high point that left me agape) \u2013 possessed Coachella with an unstoppable need to dance, primal screams of the gagged. Gaga\u2019s voice, honed with time, was more dextrous and luminous than ever, and though she didn\u2019t miss a note, the performance was as much a feat of acting as singing \u2013 Gaga the possessed, the haughty, the hunted, the strangled, the Oscar nominee. Her performances often have the feeling of life-or-death stakes; even a track as sinuously groovy as Killah gets the embodiment of a demonic fever, accompanied by French producer Gesaffelstein entombed in black, the oil-slicked phantom of Gaga\u2019s twisted opera. But in the spirit of duality, she also broke character just enough \u2013 to salute her fans, her fiance, her spiritual belief of interconnectedness. \u201cThe truth is we\u2019re all one. It\u2019s all just one big fucking thing,\u201d she said before the triumphant victory lap of Born This Way. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d The mayhem carried through a transcendent finale of Bad Romance staged, naturally, as a Frankenstein-esque revivification with plague masks, Gaga\u2019s face at the conclusion shifting between performance snarl and personal joy. With both, she led not one but two extended curtain calls with the full cast and crew \u2013 unusual for a music festival, but fitting for an all-timer night of pop theater in the desert.",

        "bodyText": "Pop stars spend their careers impaled on the horns of a perennial dilemma: whether to reinvent themselves and show range, or stick to core value variations. With Mayhem, her sixth solo album, her 10th overall, Lady Gaga has dumped the former strategy, which was stuttering of late, for an emphatic reiteration of the latter. Mayhem marks a wholesale return to dancefloor freakiness, complete with self-quotes (Abracadabra) and a hard-edged electronic takedown of fame (Perfect Celebrity) that would not have been misplaced on her debut album, 2008\u2019s The Fame. Almost everything here has Little Monster claws. Goth Gaga brings with her zombies, beasts and disease, plus a handful of convincing funk diversions (Killah). But other spectres hover over this banquet: Madonna, most obviously, but also Charli xcx \u2013 who has been channelling authentic outsider club-pop for the decade Gaga has been pursuing jazz and acting \u2013 plus Chappell Roan, self-made convenor of the queer party people. Most unexpectedly of all, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the Taylor Swift-alike How Bad Do U Want Me is intended as homage or satire, but it sits a touch oddly on a record that purports to know who the real Gaga is.",

        "trailText": "After some noteworthy musical and cinematic misfires, Gaga gets back to her core themes of sex, sleaze and celebrity on an album that sounds not retro, but relevant",
        "bodyText": "Lady Gaga\u2019s single Abracadabra is enjoying its fifth consecutive week in the UK Top 10. You can imagine a collective sigh of relief chez Gaga: she has been experiencing what you might call a case of career sea sickness, in which unadulterated commercial triumphs have been followed by very public flops. In the credit column, there\u2019s Die With a Smile, a power-ballad duet with Bruno Mars that went to No 1 in 28 countries and spent 10 weeks as the world\u2019s biggest-selling single. (Released last August, it also appears on Mayhem.) In the debit, there was her starring role in the disastrous Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, a film that was estimated to have lost Warner Brothers something in the region of $150m (\u00a3116m), and which seemed to take both the Gaga-heavy soundtrack and her own, jazz-based \u201ccompanion album\u201d Harlequin down with it. You might have expected the legions of Little Monsters (as her fans are known) to rally around the latter, but apparently not. Outside of a couple of remix collections, it was the lowest-selling Lady Gaga album to date and her second jazz album to noticeably underperform: a follow-up collection of duets with the late Tony Bennett, 2021\u2019s Love for Sale, failed to replicate the success of its predecessor, Cheek to Cheek. One theory is that Gaga\u2019s eclecticism might have succeeded in confusing people. The fact that you never quite know what she\u2019s going to throw out next \u2013 electronic dance-pop, soft rock, jazz, country, AOR \u2013 should be cause for celebration, but perhaps it has proved a bit much in a world dominated by streaming\u2019s overload, where artists are advised to maintain a clear brand lest they get lost amid the sheer torrent of new music. Maybe what was needed was a bold restatement of Gaga\u2019s original core values. That was precisely what Abracadabra, and indeed its predecessor, Disease, provided: big dirty synths; big noisy choruses; high-camp, fashion-forward videos and, in the case of Abracadabra, a hook apparently designed to remind listeners of the word-mangling intro to 2009\u2019s Bad Romance. All this turns out to be a fair advertisement for the rest of Mayhem, which does a lot of things that anyone who fell hard for Gaga\u2019s debut album, The Fame, might reasonably want her to do. Fizzy electronics battle for space with piano and guitar hooks. Virtually everything seems to have been constructed with one eye on the dancefloor: there are nods to Daft Punk, disco and 80s boogie and house. There are songs gleefully hymning the pleasures of the fleeting clubland hook-up as balm for the soul (Garden of Eden). And there are songs ruminating equivocally on the nature of fame: \u201cSit in the front row, watch the princess die,\u201d she sings on Perfect Celebrity, both a decent pun and analogous to her \u201cperformance art piece enacting the death of celebrity\u201d at the 2009 MTV awards, during which she sang Paparazzi while appearing to bleed out from a gash on her stomach. It\u2019s consistently well-written, teeming with hooks and liberally sprinkled with intriguing musical left-turns. The Prince-esque electro-funk of Killah suddenly erupts into a double-time beat that\u2019s equal parts clipped new-wave rock and techstep drum\u2019n\u2019bass; the Chic-style disco of Zombieboy is unexpectedly disrupted by a widdly-woo hair metal guitar solo. Equally, it is smart enough to marshal its star\u2019s diversity. LoveDrug indulges Gaga\u2019s love of AOR, but a four-to-the-floor rhythm means it doesn\u2019t jar with its surroundings. Her penchant for old-fashioned power ballads is manifested in Blade of Grass, but the song is smartly tacked on to the end of an otherwise dance-focused album, alongside the similarly minded Die With a Smile. The only obvious misstep is How Bad Do U Want Me?, which starts out great \u2013 a homage to early 80s synth-pop, specifically Yazoo \u2013 but devolves into a song over which the melodic influence of Taylor Swift hangs a little too obviously. In truth, How Bad Do U Want Me? isn\u2019t a bad song, but there\u2019s something a little craven about it. Moreover, Lady Gaga doesn\u2019t really need to chase current pop trends: Mayhem may be a reversion to core values \u2013 to the Lady Gaga of 2008 \u2013 but the striking thing is that it doesn\u2019t feel particularly retro. Instead, it seems curiously of the moment: both Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-queen aesthetic and outsider appeal and Charli xcx\u2019s avant-trash place them in Gaga\u2019s lineage. Mayhem can\u2019t replicate the jolt that accompanied Lady Gaga\u2019s arrival, blood-spattered live performances and all, but it doesn\u2019t need to. It\u2019s a reversion to first principles that reminds you how prescient its author was in the first place: she sounds like someone returning to claim a place in a pop world that has come round to her way of thinking.",

        "headline": "$500 for the nosebleeds? Lady Gaga fans furious over ticket prices for Australian shows",
        "trailText": "The Mayhem tour\u2019s ticketing agencies deny dynamic pricing has been implemented, but fans have complained prices are high and inconsistent",
        "bodyText": "The little monsters are not happy. Lady Gaga fans have swamped social media to complain about exorbitant ticket prices for the pop star\u2019s Australian concerts, with many speculating that dynamic pricing is involved \u2013 a claim the official ticketing agency for the Melbourne and Brisbane shows, Ticketmaster, has denied. Off the back of her chart-topping album Mayhem, Lady Gaga is heading to Australia for the first time in 11 years, with Live Nation bringing the Mayhem Ball to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in December. Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation, is responsible for the ticket sales in Melbourne and Brisbane. Ticketek is separately handling the Sydney show, because of its affiliation with Sydney venue Accor Stadium. Ahead of the Melbourne pre-sales opening on Monday, Ticketmaster\u2019s website said tickets \u201chave been priced in advance by the tour from $113.06 to $1581.12\u201d, excluding a ticket handling fee. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter But fans swamped social media on Monday and Tuesday to complain that even seats in the nosebleeds were costing hundreds of dollars. One fan posted a screenshot of the ticket prices for the Melbourne concert at Marvel stadium, ranging from $204.80 for standing-room tickets and $255.77 for tickets in level 3 (the further tier back) to $649.38 for tickets in level 1 (the tier of seating closest to the stage). \u201cDynamic pricing is on (ticket prices rise due to demand),\u201d the fan wrote. Dynamic or in-demand ticketing means ticket prices rise and fall according to demand, much like Uber surge pricing or airline tickets. The practice has proved controversial with live music fans, who can find themselves forking out hundreds extra for a ticket, depending on when they buy it. Another posted a screenshot showing a ticket in the back tier of seating at Marvel Stadium priced at almost $500, writing: \u201cNo bloody way. I\u2019m not paying that much for seats in the nosebleeds for Gaga. Bloody dynamic pricing.\u201d Some said they were seeing prices leap hundreds of dollars while they were queueing to buy them. Dynamic pricing can work the other way, too: Melbourne fan Jacinda Chenelle said in a TikTok video that she had seen the price of the same ticket reduce from $300 to $153 in less than two hours. On Wednesday during the Live Nation presale, Guardian Australia was able to find a seat in the nosebleeds \u2013 level 3 of Marvel stadium \u2013 selling for $316.65. Level 2 tickets were available for $609.28, level 1 for $709.28, and a VIP ticket for the standing-room-only front section, with early entry, was selling for $714.55. The various prices for these tickets were not disclosed in advance, and fans reported spending hours waiting to reach the front of the queue before finding out the cost, while a countdown clock showed the diminishing window of time in which they had to either purchase or get kicked out of the sale. Many fans have accused Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation Entertainment of turning on dynamic pricing for the presales. In the past, both Ticketmaster and Ticketek have defended the practice, telling Guardian Australia prices were set by artists and their teams. They also claim demand-driven pricing mitigates the problem of ticket scalping, when tickets are bought and resold at inflated prices \u2013 though consumer rights group Choice has argued that the practice actually makes it harder to regulate scalpers. Ticketek, the official ticket agent for Lady Gaga\u2019s Sydney show, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday that pre-sale tickets for Sydney were not dynamically priced. But Ticketek\u2019s page for Lady Gaga\u2019s concert includes the warning that \u201cthe price of a ticket offered for sale for this event may increase or decrease anytime prior to the event, based on demand.\u201d A Ticketmaster spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cTickmaster does not have surge pricing or dynamic algorithms to adjust ticket prices. Tickets were priced in advance of the sale and set at the individual seat level.\u201d Demand for the 14-time Grammy award winner\u2019s first Australian tour in 11 years was always going to be huge, and coming off the back of her headline slot at Coachella on the weekend, online ticket queues for her Australian shows reportedly reached upwards of 100,000. On Tuesday, Live Nation added a second Melbourne show, on 6 December, but some fans were unhappy with this tactic. One fan posted under Live Nation\u2019s Facebook post announcing the second date: \u201cWhy can\u2019t you release all show dates at once? There is always huge demand! Yet you release show dates one at a time.\u201d Another fan complained on X: \u201cTwo days ago we paid $726 for two tickets to Lady Gaga\u2019s Melbourne show. Decent seats. Today, ONE ticket in the same bay for the second show is $649.\u201d Tickets will go on general sale on Thursday 17 April.",

        "headline": "Lady Gaga, Will Ferrell and Lauryn Hill headline star-studded SNL concert",
        "trailText": "A host of Saturday Night Live cast members and music stars hit New York on Valentine\u2019s Day for a mammoth 50th anniversary concert",
        "bodyText": "It seems like a daunting task, to sum up 50 years of music in one night. But when you harbor its cultural cachet, the respect artists have for Saturday Night Live and its stunningly expansive rolodex, as well as the sheer production power of both SNL honcho Lorne Michaels and producer Mark Ronson, the result is a three-hour-plus extravaganza to rival even the starriest, most packed Grammys, Oscars or its ilk. Amid New York\u2019s bitter chill on Valentine\u2019s night, the event took place at Radio City Music Hall, a perfect home considering its Rockefeller Center confines are only a hop, skip and a jump from SNL\u2019s Studio 8H at nearby NBC Studios. Its art deco space serves as the epitome of New York City: a tourist mecca beloved by hardscrabble locals. So it seemed natural that the Rockettes and SNL would both have graced its hallowed stage at one time. It was clear this was a unique audience. Aside from normal fans who populated the pit, the audience was made up of former hosts, cast members, writers and friends of the show. The show\u2019s expansive legacy played out as a dynamic tapestry in the lobby: lumbering down its carpeted floor flanked by his family was a baseball hat-clad Chevy Chase, a veteran of the original 1975 cast. Over there, in a tank top in line for beer at the concession stand, palling around with the bartender, was Jason Momoa; nearby, Pete Davidson (cast member 2014-2022) kibitzed with Nate Bargatze. All-star SNL host Alec Baldwin chatted gamely and caught up with the SNL team, as Paul Rudd and James Franco hugged it out outside. Sharp-in-a-suit Miles Teller, a former host, and his wife seemed to be on a double date with fellow former host Anya Taylor-Joy and her husband. Former cast members Jon Lovitz (1985-1990) and Horatio Sanz (1998-2006) also hugged it out. New-generation stars also made their presence known, from Hot Ones ringleader Sean Evans to the comedian/podcast host Theo Von, as did TV personality besties Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper, to name a small smattering of faces. Inside, the 6,000-seat venue was outfitted with three stages, two of them flanked by replicas of Grand Central Station, a nod to the show\u2019s current set. Opening the proceedings was Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon (cast member 1998-2004), who busted out an energetic tribute to the Blues Brothers: perhaps it was too energetic, with Fallon subsequently out of breath for his monologue, adding a sense of energy. \u201cI have two things in common with SNL,\u201d he said into the mic. \u201cThis year we both turn 50 and, if we\u2019re being honest, we both peaked around 25.\u201d The show was divided into segments meant to honor a specific aspect of SNL\u2019s music history. Miley Cyrus, who memorably sang during SNL\u2019s 40th anniversary special 10 years ago, helped start things off with her own hit Flowers as well as a tribute to Queen in the form of a cover of Crazy Little Thing Called Love, which the Freddie Mercury-backed band performed on the show in 1982. Bad Bunny was trotted out to show continuing force, as the Puerto Rican icon performed his latest hit DtMF. In tribute to frequent SNL guest Tom Petty, Eddie Vedder performed The Waiting while nodding to other fallen SNL favorites, like John Belushi and Gilda Radner. Jelly Roll paid tribute to Johnny Cash, while Post Malone and the surviving members of Nirvana sang Smells Like Teen Spirit (they were introduced as Post Nirvana), while an alt all-star mashup of David Byrne, Arcade Fire and St Vincent teamed up for Heroes in honor of David Bowie (who performed on the show four times, first making his debut in 1979). Following up memorable appearances during both Fire Aid and the Grammys earlier this month was Lady Gaga. When she first tried to perform her Star Is Born hit Shallow early in the show, she was sitting alongside Andy Samberg, who, in a cowboy hat, garbled the song\u2019s first line deliciously out of key. \u201cAndy, Andy, I gotta stop you,\u201d said Gaga with her hands on her head. \u201c\u2019Cause it\u2019s bad?\u201d he shot back. \u201cYes, it\u2019s very bad,\u201d she said. In reality, it was a gag to lead into a medley of Samberg\u2019s comedy trio The Lonely Island\u2019s range of viral musical parodies including Dick in a Box (with Gaga taking original duet partner Justin Timberlake\u2019s lines), I Just Had Sex (assisted by Bad Bunny) and I\u2019m on a Boat (assisted by T-Pain). Most impressive was a performance of Lazy Sunday, a rap he concocted with cast member Chris Parnell (1998-2006) with the two delivering a pitch-perfect version of the song that shot him to fame and wound up popularizing YouTube at the time. The extravaganza was sprinkled with a bevy of other comedy music moments, with Bill Murray (and his 70s-era Nick the Lounge Singer bit) as well as Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer (as hopelessly-out-of-touch music teachers Bobbi and Marty Culp), the latter of whom nerdily covered Kendrick Lamar\u2019s fresh from the Super Bowl anthem Not Like Us. Elsewhere, Tracy Morgan sang his swingin\u2019 theme to his popular sketch Astronaut Jones. \u201cPlease take your seats, please take your seats,\u201d the director pleaded into the mic every commercial break as the connected audience caught up with each other. Despite its extended runtime, the show\u2019s incredible zigzagging demanded and secured everybody\u2019s ongoing attention, with the audience perhaps cheering loudest for Cher (If I Could Turn Back Time) and the Backstreet Boys, with the crowd (including Jerry Seinfeld) singing along to every word of I Want It That Way. Meanwhile, Brandi Carlile earned a standing ovation for her 2018 ballad The Joke. You know it was a big night when Chris Martin merely served as a piano player for one set, simply accompanying Bonnie Raitt on Thing Called Love, a song she originally performed on the show in 1990. Speaking of all-star musicians, The Roots deftly served as house band; with Questlove on drums, they helped back everyone from the B-52\u2019s to Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Elsewhere, Snoop Dogg rapped Gin and Juice, which he performed on the show in 1994 (then known as Snoop Doggy Dogg, of course). By the end of any regular episode of Saturday Night Live, it\u2019s clear where the highs and lows were; the very nature of the show is that it\u2019s designed to represent a disparate litany of comedic tastes. Music, perhaps, is less subjective; every song has a beat to latch on to. Perhaps in that sense, as Jack White closed things out with Seven Nation Army, the homecoming bash was void of any low points. If only every concert were like this.",

        "bodyText": "The new episode of Saturday Night Live opens in the White House, where, per an explosive New York Times article, a cabinet meeting ended in a shouting match between the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, (Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez) and the Doge head, Elon Musk (Mike Myers). Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) attempts to broker a truce between the two. The meeting doesn\u2019t go well, with each man drifting off into their own internal monologues: Rubio just hears the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme; Trump\u2019s thoughts weave between Adrien Brody and Waluigi before attaining a first ever bout of self-awareness, and Musk questions his decision to take over the government now that everybody hates him, his Tesla stock is tanking and his personal wealth has taken a hit. This seems to be leading to something, but just when it starts getting interesting (when Myers finally shows up), it comes to an abrupt halt. Myers\u2019s turn as Musk last week was a much-needed course correction. The show was finally, properly going after the oligarch, who oozes second-hand embarrassment, with a brutal (but accurate) portrayal. This week\u2019s feels less pointed, with Myers turning him into his Dr Evil character (himself based on SNL showrunner Lorne Michaels). Disappointing, to say the least. Lady Gaga pulls double duty as host and musical guest. Fresh off the most memorable performance of SNL\u2019s big 50th anniversary concert special, Gaga wants to remind everyone that, in her own words, \u201cI\u2019m an amazing actor,\u201d even as she wants to distance herself from her last time hosting, since R Kelly was the musical guest that night. She pokes fun of her recent bomb, Joker 2, for which she won a Razzie: \u201c[It] brings me one step closer to an EGORT. It\u2019s like an EGOT, but it\u2019s hurtful.\u201d She promises to \u201cact, sing, and not do Joker 3\u201d. It\u2019s not much of a monologue, but you have to figure she\u2019s saving the fireworks for later. In her first sketch, Gaga plays an aspiring chef saying goodbye to her boyfriend (and his adorable pug) before leaving for culinary school in Paris via ridable luggage. He immediately regrets their decision to part and follows her on his own motorized suitcase. The initial sight gag of Gaga scooting around on the luggage is good for a laugh, but that\u2019s all there is to it. A tiny, Stuart Little-like mouse named Pip attempts to train for the big high school weightlifting competition. We get a classic \u201980s training montage set to Gaga\u2019s inspirational ballad. On the big day, Pip maxes out a measly 2 ounces himself, but when the gymnasium\u2019s roof collapses on the other students, he provides the extra muscle needed to lift it and save them \u2013 all except for his bully, who gets liquidated. The animation \u2013 a mix of puppetry and CGI \u2013 is impressive, and while not on the level of Robert Smigel or Lonely Island shorts, these Dan Bulla shorts do stand out from the rest of the show aesthetically. Gaga and Bowen Yang are a pretentious couple on a first date at a fancy restaurant. They start dancing in the middle of the room while carrying on a bizarre and personally revealing rendition of You Look Wonderful Tonight. A truly blue double entendre about Yang coming into money (\u201cthere weren\u2019t any tissues around\u201d) deservedly earns guffaws from the audience. I\u2019m genuinely surprised that made it past the network censors. Then, Gaga and Heidi Gardner play funeral planners obsessively pitching a Roaring \u201920s-themed service to a woman whose father was recently murdered, replete with an old-timey bartender, gin rickeys and flappers. Kind of just seems like an excuse to have Gaga cut a rug for a few moments. L\u2019Or\u00e9al Easy Run Mascara intentionally smears all over your face to \u201clet the world know: yes, I have been crying, and no, I\u2019m not OK\u201d. It\u2019s unique formula of \u201cbeing really, really low-quality mascara and also a little printer ink\u201d makes it perfect for messy drama queens everywhere. Yang excitedly introduces Gaga for her first song of the night. Wearing a sparkly red body suit, and surrounded by black-clad dancers, she performs her new single Abracadabra. It\u2019s exactly the bombastic performance everyone was anticipating from her. On Weekend Update, Michael Che brings on outspoken NBA commentator Kendrick Perkins (Kenan Thompson) to discuss the upcoming playoff season. Perkins spreads made-up facts and rumors about the recently traded Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (\u201cI ain\u2019t no doctor, but by my estimations, I believe he gonna be dead by April), Larry Bird (\u201ccreated by scientists in the back of a Cracker Barrel\u201d), LeBron James (\u201cHe works undercover as a French superspy \u2026 the name is LeBron, James LeBron\u201d). Later, Colin Jost welcomes on Lady Gaga\u2019s rarely seen husband, Lord Gaga (Mikey Day). The snooty British aristocrat tries to downplay his wife\u2019s \u201chobby\u201d even as he tries to cash in on her cachet by dropping titles of her songs \u2013 Born this Way, Bad Romance, Little Monsters \u2013 throughout his chat. The best bits are devoted to poking fun at Jost over his own famous wife making far more money than him. A foursome of friends enjoys a nostalgic meal at chain restaurant Friendly\u2019s. They lie about it being one of their birthdays to get the special birthday song and a free sundae. Things take a dark turn when the creepy Friendly\u2019s staff intuit that she\u2019s lying, resulting in a demonic black mass and ritual sacrifice. This falls on the wrong side of goofy. For her second set, Lady Gaga moves from back-to-center stage in a kinetic rendition of the glam-rocky Killah. Then, she plays one of several older, book-loving women pitching Little Red Glasses. The colorful eyewear is great for ladies who have Celestial Greetings credit cards, make their own peanut butter and \u201cwent down on Leonard Cohen\u201d. A very specific sendup of a very specific type, this one slowly wins over the live crowd. The episode concludes with another restaurant-set sketch, where Yang and Gaga sing to their fellow brunch-goers about the need to stop using ubiquitous and annoying millennial/gen-Z speak such as \u201cslay\u201d, \u201cbop\u201d, \u201cflex\u201d, \u201cbey\u201d, \u201csus\u201d, \u201cgiving\u201d, \u201cmother\u201d, and more. Not nearly as cringeworthy as the last time the show attempted to send up modern slang. As a night of sketch comedy, this was all very middle of the road. There was nothing memorable about it, but there weren\u2019t any obvious stinkers either. But the main event was always going to be the musical performances. On that score, Lady Gaga certainly succeeded, delivering the exclamation point on the recent run of episodes and specials surrounding the 50th anniversary.",

        "bodyText": "Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish are reported to be headlining this month\u2019s benefit concert to raise money for those affected by the California wildfires. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the lineup for the FireAid benefit concert also includes Jelly Roll, Lil Baby, Tate McRae and Gwen Stefani. Acts also listed yet not officially confirmed by TMZ include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day and Gracie Abrams with more names to be added. It\u2019s scheduled to take place on 30 January. The wildfires, which started earlier this month, have taken a devastating toll on California with a death toll of 25 and a further 38 missing. More than 12,000 structures have been either destroyed or damaged. FireAid was announced last week with partners Live Nation, AEG and the Azoff Company. The concert will take place at the Intuit Dome, the home venue of the Los Angeles Clippers. Proceeds will \u201cfocus on rebuilding infrastructure, supporting displaced families and advancing fire prevention technologies and strategies\u201d. The Eagles have already donated $2.5m towards the event. It is unclear yet if they will also be performing. Back in 2018, Lady Gaga worked with the Red Cross to deliver pizzas to those affected by wildfires after she was also forced to evacuate her Malibu home. Stefani also started a college-scholarship fund for students affected by wildfires back in 2007. Eilish has already spoken about this year\u2019s wildfires, urging her followers to help support a number of non-profits. \u201cWhile our family is safe, many of the people and communities we love have endured devastating loss,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cAltadena in particular is very close to our hearts ... it was the backyard of our childhoods, and the families, businesses, nonprofits, and musicians there remain cornerstones in our lives.\u201d Celebrities who have donated major sums toward relief efforts include Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Lee Curtis. \u201cThis is literally where I live \u2013 everything, the market I shop in, the schools my kids go to,\u201d she said. \u201cFriends, many, many, many, many, many friends, now have lost their homes.\u201d",

        "trailText": "Music A-listers from Dr Dre to Olivia Rodrigo perform at fundraising extravaganza FireAid at neighboring LA arenas",
        "bodyText": "Making my way through the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, it was clear that FireAid was set to be a different kind of musical extravaganza. Taking place simultaneously at both the state-of-the-art arena (which opened in August) and the longtime city staple the Kia Forum, the roster, which included everyone from Joni Mitchell to Peso Pluma, was announced in the wake of the devastating fires that struck the area earlier this month and broadcast around the world to raise funds and awareness, the atmosphere before showtime was neither celebratory nor subdued, striking a delicate balance to coalesce over a common love for Los Angeles and its ongoing strife. A red carpet where flashbulbs are usually popping was mostly quiet as a mouse, with photographers invariably checking their lenses; perhaps the stars in attendance knew it would be inept to have a fashion moment on such an occasion. Even inside the arena, the usual pre-concert buzz of boisterous mingling and drink sipping was missing. Kicking off at the Forum, Green Day opened the show; an apt choice to slowly rev up the proceedings considering the rockers exude that California pedigree (they\u2019re from the Bay Area, after all) before welcoming Los Angeles native Billie Eilish for a rendition of the band\u2019s 2019 song Last Night on Earth. Eilish would provide a bookend, helping start the proceedings here and then helping close them nearly six hours later with a set of her own alongside brother Finneas. And no, she didn\u2019t sing the Barbie song. To welcome the crowd, perennial master of ceremonies Billy Crystal took the stage. Poignantly missing was his usual black tie associated with his starry hosting gigs: tonight he flaunted a hoodie and knit cap, which Crystal said were all he wore after he was evacuated and his home was destroyed. After announcing a $1m donation from U2 (seemingly one of the only acts in music not on the roster), Crystal delivered an emotional speech comparing the death of his father as a young boy to this recent tragedy, and the healing power of laughter. Naturally he cracked, \u201cThis young girl came up to me, and said she understood my pain because she had lost TikTok for a day,\u201d Crystal said, before adding: \u201cWith your help around the country and here in the room, we\u2019ll laugh again, we\u2019re gonna listen to music again, and we will be OK.\u201d Volleying back and forth between the arenas, the roster was like hitting shuffle on a music nerd\u2019s eclectic playlist. Alanis Morissette, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and Pink were all on hand busting out a mix of their biggest hits and covers, with the latter singer noting she\u2019ll have her feet down on the ground on this occasion, a wry nod to her normal high-flying wire routine. Sometimes the juxtaposition was fierce: Graham Nash delivered a rendition of his 1968 Hollies-era ballad Teach Your Children, while Anderson .Paak brought out Dr Dre and Sheila E for a mini hip-hop concert that naturally included Dre\u2019s 1995 collaboration with 2Pac, California Love. In fact, almost every California anthem one could think of was on full display at FireAid, perhaps save for Randy Newman\u2019s I Love LA. Inside the Intuit Dome, Katy Perry sang her pop confection California Gurls, as well as Roar and Rise, the latter flanked (at least momentarily) by the Pasadena Chorale. (Notably Perry skipped any songs from her most recent ill-received album 143). Meanwhile Jelly Roll, assisted by SoCal native Travis Barker on the drums, fashioned a rollicking spin on the 70s Bob Seger classic Hollywood Nights while the Red Hot Chili Peppers closed out the Kia Forum portion of the show with the longest set of the night and a spate of their own odes to the City of Angels with pitch-perfect renditions including Californication and Dani California. And proving the night wasn\u2019t too somber, Flea performed in nothing but underwear. Fellow 90s rock icons No Doubt, perhaps reliving their recent Coachella reunion, also took to the stage, though they curiously focused on a gender-split singalong to Just a Girl. Guitar geeks had to be happy, with appearances by John Mayer, Joan Jett, Slash and the surviving members of Nirvana. The latter band, who only get together for charity shows and one-offs, flaunted an array of frontwomen including Kim Gordon, St Vincent and drummer Dave Grohl\u2019s daughter Violet; however, their set stumbled a bit thanks to sound mix issues. Baby boomers and gen Z were also well represented with the likes of John Fogerty (79) and Rod Stewart (80) energetically commanding the stage, while Olivia Rodrigo (21) and Gracie Abrams (25) all flaunted their biggest hits; the crowds spreading the love equally among the generations. Despite the once-in-a-lifetime nature of the concert, as the night went on and midnight approached, the audience was getting listless. The father next to me, with two young girls, was nodding off. It was a school night after all, but it was clear promoters saved Lady Gaga, one of the night\u2019s major draws, for last. Sting, who performed as the audience inside the Intuit Dome started to chat among themselves, couldn\u2019t fully capture their attention. By 12.30 Stevie Wonder sang Love\u2019s in Need of Love Today, which he previously performed at a bevy of charity events including the America: A Tribute to Heroes concert in the days following 9/11, before Flea and Sting joined him for Higher Ground. Finally, Gaga appeared with dyed eyebrows and a black wig. Sitting at a piano, she performed a pair of A Star Is Born tracks: the earworm Always Remember Us This Way and Shallow, before surprising the audience with a new one. Written with fiance Michael Polansky, she said she crafted it \u201cjust for tonight\u201d, albeit it sounded more Broadway than the Gaga-pop she\u2019s known for. By the end of the night, it was lost how much money was raised; gone are the Jerry Lewis telethon days when a ticker showed the numbers climbing higher and higher. Perhaps the number was so big it could have discouraged additional donations. Regardless of the figure, FireAid proved the power of music and how a just cause can bring together polar opposites. If anything, here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s a harbinger for the future.",

        "trailText": "After a run of power ballads and jazz standards \u2013 plus the mega-flop Joker sequel \u2013 this synthpop single is a reminder of the Gaga of old, while still fitting into Brat-era pop",
        "bodyText": "Thus far, 2024 has proved a decidedly mixed bag for Lady Gaga. On the plus side, her duet with Bruno Mars, Die With a Smile was a huge global hit: nine weeks after its release, it is still resident in the UK Top 3 and is the second most-streamed song in the world on Spotify. But then there was the debacle of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, and her accompanying album Harlequin was released to a very muted critical and commercial response. Gaga has done an impressive job of carrying her audience along with her throughout an eclectic approach to pop in which arty synthpop coexists alongside stadium-sized soft-rock, country-infused Americana and vocal jazz \u2013 but she seemed finally to have lost them: a third album of standards, this time without her late duet partner Tony Bennett, and allied to one of the year\u2019s biggest box office bombs, apparently proved a step too far. Perhaps she can rectify things with Disease, a song that that ignores the fact that her biggest successes in recent years have been power ballads \u2013 not just Die With a Smile but the 10m-selling Shallow \u2013 and returns her to old-fashioned Gaga territory. Certainly, her stans seem to think she can. Within hours of the single appearing, one of them had worked up such a froth they posted a 1,500-word online essay comparing its lyrics to Sylvia Plath, Baudelaire and the sonnets of John Donne, which even those impressed with the sexually forthright thrust of its chorus \u2013 \u201clay you down like one-two-three, your eyes roll back in ecstasy\u201d \u2013 might think amounts to gilding the lily a little. But you don\u2019t have to go that far to think Disease could conceivably have slotted on Gaga\u2019s debut album The Fame. It involves fizzing, distorted synths playing dark minor chords; a pounding, slightly industrial four-to-the-floor beat; vocals in the strident, imperious mode of Poker Face or The Cure; and lyrics that, if they don\u2019t bear much resemblance to the work of the Metaphysical poets, do seem a bit dominatrix-y: \u201cScreaming for me baby, like you\u2019re gonna die.\u201d It\u2019s very well produced, and if the song doesn\u2019t have the undeniable, head-turning, instant-classic quality of Bad Romance \u2013 it lacks the element of surprise found in that track\u2019s brilliant melodic and tonal shift from dark-hued verses to sunlit Abba-esque chorus \u2013 its excessive, more-is-more sound and mood manage to evoke memories of late 00s Gaga and still fit with the messy, post-Brat pop climate. Which makes a kind of tenuous sense: on arrival, with her meat dresses and faintly chaotic, blood-spattered, downtown-performance-art-inspired live shows, Lady Gaga felt like a disruptive force, her cage-rattling effect on pop not a million miles removed from Charli xcx\u2019s this summer.",

His appearance at Coachella comes five years after his aborted headline performance at the 2020 festival, which was cancelled due to Covid. He was then booked again for the 2022 festival, then removed from the lineup when 10 people died in a crowd crush at his Astroworld festival in 2021. This will be the second time Lady Gaga has headlined Coachella, having stepped in to replace Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017 when she postponed her performance due to her pregnancy. Post Malone has performed at Coachella multiple times before but has never headlined. In their 37-year career, Green Day has never performed at Coachella, though Billie Joe Armstrong joined the Replacements on stage in 2014. \u201cDeath, taxes, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll,\u201d Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told Rolling Stone. \u201cIn this world gone sideways, we know one thing for certain: rock\u2019n\u2019roll is forever, and its spirit is needed now more than ever.

Last year\u2019s Coachella headliners were Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt, but the festival saw its slowest ticket sales for a decade.

        "bodyText": "Stars such as Lady Gaga, Charli xcx, Ed Sheeran and Missy Elliott will face blazing temperatures this weekend at an unusually hot Coachella festival. The California-based festival will soar to potentially record-breaking highs of 103F (over 39C) in its first of two consecutive weekends, about 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit higher than what\u2019s typically expected at this time of year. The festival, which usually attracts around 125,000 people a day, is following a year that saw its slowest sales to date, headlined by Doja Cat, Lana del Rey and Tyler, the Creator. The 2025 edition is being viewed by some as an unofficial comeback with headliners Lady Gaga, Green Day and Post Malone, who together boast 24% higher global Spotify streams than the previous trio. Gaga previously headlined Coachella in 2017, when she also filmed scenes for A Star Is Born. In a recent interview, she said she would focus on her new album, Mayhem, but also give fans the older hits they want. She said she saw it as \u201can opportunity to do something unique and special\u201d but remained tightlipped about specifics. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t want to give anything away about Coachella,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that is heartless of me, in a way, but I could honestly cry on the phone with you just thinking about how excited I am to do this show, and I want it to be a total surprise, and want everyone to have as much fun as possible.\u201d The lineup boasts a wide variety of acts from different genres and eras. The newer guard is represented by Lola Young, Shaboozey, Amyl and the Sniffers, Rema, underscores and Glorilla, while nostalgia plays are led by Jimmy Eat World, Missy Elliott, Kraftwerk, Basement Jaxx and the Go-Gos. The weekend will also see the Prodigy play, returning to Coachella for the first time since Keith Flint died in 2019. \u201cI will say that us carrying on isn\u2019t a Keith tribute show,\u201d band member Liam Howlett recently told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe want to honor him, and we will continue to do that, because Keith is more than just a person they saw on stage. Even though he wasn\u2019t a musician, he was such an important person in the studio as a right-hand man.\u201d Another throwback act playing is Weezer, a band who have been making headlines this week after bassist Scott Shriner\u2019s wife, Jillian Lauren, was shot by police. Reports claim that she aimed a handgun at officers as they investigated an unrelated hit-and-run incident and she is now being charged with attempted murder. The band is still set to perform as scheduled with Scott saying \u201csee you at Coachella\u201d to journalists on Thursday. One act who won\u2019t be performing is FKA twigs, who was forced to pull out \u201cdue to ongoing visa issues\u201d related to her production team reportedly failing to fill out the correct paperwork in time. The star wrote that she was \u201cdevastated\u201d in an Instagram statement. Rising costs and more complicated logistics have also caused trouble for other artists seeking visas to perform. \u201cI just did visas for a Coachella band and it was $8,000,\u201d a booking agency executive told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a huge financial hurdle because it takes so long through regular channels, you have to go for the heavy-duty expediting.\u201d",

        "bodyText": "Despite its reputation for bohemian escape \u2013 a music Disneyland for adults in the desert \u2013 Coachella can often feel like a gauntlet. The drive from Los Angeles to Indio will set you back anywhere from three to five hours, the lines even more; some campers endured 12-hour lines to access the site. A three-day general admissions pass went for a whopping $649 this year, $220 more than just five years ago, and that\u2019s not counting money spent on lodging, food and outfits suitable for temp swings of 40F. No wonder over half of attendees this year were on payment plans. Unless Revolve is footing your bill, what 20-something can afford Coachella? Such was the latest strain of bad press for North America\u2019s largest music festival, which \u2013 depending on who you talk to \u2013 is recovering from its flop year of depressed ticket sales in 2024. Whether the inflammatory headlines comparing it to Fyre Festival (wrong) or questioning gen Z\u2019s financial literacy (fair) are out of genuine concern or Fomo-laced schadenfreude, Coachella is certainly in some form of identity shift, with the question of who it\u2019s for, who attends and what it represents in palpable flux over the course of its first 2025 weekend. On the one hand, the festival draws a more international lineup and diverse crowd than its flower-crown reputation suggests; though it of course skews young, there were plenty of middle-aged adults (with, presumably, more robust bank accounts) mixed in with high schoolers, gaggles of shirtless men, college kids on drugs and the occasional baby with headphones on. On the other, well, it\u2019s hard to walk more than a few feet in the rapidly browning grass without either interrupting a photo or being asked to take one, the festival\u2019s appearance-oriented clientele still hopelessly tied to the \u2018gram and the game of envy. But those who did make it were rewarded by solid sets and deep dehydration \u2013 temperatures reached a scorching 102F (39C) on Friday, making 2025 the hottest festival on record. \u201cIt\u2019s hottttttttt \u2026 but it\u2019s nice\u201d rasped Djo, AKA Stranger Things\u2019 Joe Keery, on Friday afternoon in a sweltering Mojave cool kids\u2019 tent, attendees bopping to chill songs of existential ennui and anxiety while sweating through their shirts. \u201cThe weather\u2019s not like this in England, I can tell you that,\u201d lamented a miserable looking beabadoobee in the Sunday glare; the Filipino-British singer nonetheless turned out a winsome set of alt-rock shredding that recalled both Liz Phair and Michelle Branch. Good luck to anyone performing before 7pm, though the heat lent the whole affair a sense of survivors\u2019 bonding \u2013 the sight of drummer Tr\u00e9 Cool sweating off his glitter eye shadow during Green Day\u2019s Saturday night set, long after the sun went down, was perhaps the most representative image of a weekend that had many melting face. Rising temps met simmering discontent. Recession indicators abounded, from screaming to Green Day\u2019s American Idiot (\u201cI\u2019m not part of a Maga agenda,\u201d singer Billie Joe Armstrong ad-libbed), to Jimmy Eat World drenching the main stage in sweat and what is now dad rock, to Charli xcx\u2019s unofficial headliner set of pure indie sleaze. Brat green outpaced crochet on Saturday, with the British artist drawing one of the biggest crowds of the weekend to watch her stunt through bangers only with Billie Eilish, Lorde and Troye Sivan, along with numerous celebrity fans; videos circulated of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Kylie Jenner canoodling in the VIP area. Jenner\u2019s ex Travis Scott served as the semi-billed fourth headliner of the weekend, with a late Saturday set that several people I met planned to cautiously attend, citing fears about the Astroworld disaster that went unmentioned. Styled as a modern-day gladiator, attacking the beat while nearly obscured by smoke, Scott\u2019s set projected aggression without incident. Like last year, female artists saved Coachella from flopping, providing some of the biggest highs of the weekend. Charli\u2019s party-girl energy gave way to party politics, with Clairo bringing out Bernie Sanders, fresh off a Fighting Oligarchy rally in LA, as a surprise guest. Sanders called on a queer-leaning gen Z crowd to \u201clead in the fight to combat climate change, protect women\u2019s rights, and build an economy that works for all, not just the few\u201d \u2013 at a festival whose CEO has donated extensively to Republican campaigns and anti-LGBTQ+ organizations. The Go-Go\u2019s kicked off the festival with a set celebrating their 40+ years as punk leaders, proving youth is a mindset. And Lady Gaga\u2019s instantly canonical set was worth the price of admission alone, once again demonstrating Coachella\u2019s long transition into a major pop star festival in the wake of Beychella. I left my body at the sight of Gaga, haughty in queenly garb, transitioning from 2025 smash Abracadabra to 2011 hit Judas from on high. A year after Chappell Roan rocketed into the mainstream from the small Gobi stage, the South African star Tyla appeared ascendant on the Outdoor stage, holding the crowd\u2019s focus with some of the loosest hips I\u2019ve ever seen. The popheads then hustled across the grounds to Lisa \u2013 AKA Blackpink\u2019s Lalisa Manobal \u2013 at Sahara, where she cemented her solo career with a slickly produced, eardrum-puncturing set that recalled Blackpink\u2019s maximally hype headlining appearance two years ago. Her bandmate Jennie put an exclamation point on K-Pop\u2019s inroads at Coachella on Sunday, all crisp choreography and heavy beats with a cowboy hat. Megan Thee Stallion, too, went cowgirl with boots, hat and leather for indisputably the hottest dancing of the weekend. Her set delivered some of the heaviest nostalgia hits as well \u2013 during Plan B, she brought out Queen Latifah to perform U.N.I.T.Y, her 1993 track also confronting disrespect of women\u2019s bodies and choices, and Ciara to twerk for Goodies. Both incited massive crowd freak-outs, only slightly dampened by the festival cutting Megan\u2019s mic for time. And Missy Elliott melted time for her festival debut with a set that, a few technical issues aside, appealed to the past and the future at once; Get Ur Freak On and bug glasses have confirmed made it to gen Z. Nostalgia, of course, powered a good portion of a festival that depends as much on drawing the veterans as the festival bros tripping at Sahara. \u201cAs an old person I love to see how much love these old bands are getting,\u201d said a woman who appeared to be (gasp) 35 at an over-capacity crowd for Weezer\u2019s Saturday set. Basement Jaxx and Kraftwerk, both running far behind schedule at an otherwise typically tight festival, reminded why they\u2019ve long been on the Coachella lineup, back when the festival skewed heavily rock and electronic. T-Pain took attendees back to 2007 with an electrified version of Buy U a Drank that made walking through the crowd a battle against flailing limbs. Zedd portaled to 2013 with an extended version of Clarity, the high point of millennial-leaning set that brought out Maren Morris, John Mayer and Julia Michaels. Benson Boone, 22, explicitly channeling Freddie Mercury, brought out the 77-year-old Queen guitarist Brian May for Bohemian Rhapsody. And Post Malone and Shaboozey leaned into the nostalgia inherent in a country twang; the latter\u2019s voice, rich and honeyed, drew a strikingly diverse crowd for a full sing-along to A Bar Song (Tipsy), which he premiered at Coachella last year to far fewer people. For a festival that often feels too slick for its own good, there were still some surprises. The little monsters of erstwhile Nickelodeon kids\u2019 show Yo Gabba Gabba! delivered one of the most unexpectedly joyous and strange hours of the weekend \u2013 pure mascot mayhem, Duolingo owl included, for silly songs like Yummy In My Tummy, plus Weird Al and Flavor Flav for a ridiculously catchy number called I Love Bugs. That moment, vibing out to children\u2019s song about centipedes and spiders, unlocked the secret of Coachella \u2013 find whatever escape hits enough to forget the enormous start-up costs and tiers of people getting better access than you, and it\u2019s all worth it. That it took a children\u2019s show performing to a room at least 50% on drugs to find it is as good an indicator as any that Coachella is in its quarter-life crisis era, trying a little of everything, cartoon monsters to Little Monsters, to see what sticks. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2025. An earlier version identified Brian May as Queen\u2019s drummer rather than the band\u2019s guitarist.",

        "trailText": "\u2018Drip pricing\u2019 and hidden fees also being examined after tickets for \u2018nosebleed\u2019 seats rose to $622 within 15 minutes of sale beginning",
        "bodyText": "The federal government says it is continuing to work on a crackdown on dynamic pricing, \u201cdrip pricing\u201d and hidden fees after prices for even the cheapest tickets for Lady Gaga\u2019s Sydney and Melbourne concerts more than quadrupled soon after going on general sale on Thursday. \u201cThere should be no hidden costs that suddenly appear at the end of a transaction and the government is taking action on this,\u201d the arts minister, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, made a pledge in October to ban the practice. Thousands of fans queued online on the Ticketmaster site for the Melbourne concerts and the Ticketek site for the Sydney concert on Thursday morning, where advertised prices ranged from $113.06 to more than $1,500. But within 15 minutes of the sale beginning, the \u201cnosebleed\u201d seats, those furthest from the stage in the upper tiers, had risen to $622. On Thursday, Live Nation, Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company, announced that tickets for a second Sydney concert would go on sale on 22 April. Both Ticketmaster and Ticketek have denied that dynamic pricing \u2013 where the cost of tickets high in demand continue to rise while people are queueing \u2013 is in operation for the Australian Lady Gaga concerts scheduled for December. \u201cTicketmaster does not have surge pricing or dynamic algorithms to adjust ticket prices,\u201d a Ticketmaster spokesperson said. \u201cTickets were priced in advance of the sale and set at the individual seat level.\u201d Ticketmaster did not respond to the Guardian queries on how many seats priced at $113 had been allocated to the Melbourne venue before tickets going on sale. Nor did Ticketek respond over the number of $113 seats allocated to the Sydney concert, but told the Guardian on Tuesday its pre-sale tickets were not dynamically priced. Before entering caretaker mode, the Labor government was in the midst of a consultation period looking into how to ban what it called unfair trading practices, including subscription traps, drip pricing and dynamic pricing. \u201cThese practices are unAustralian and have a real hit on people\u2019s hip pockets,\u201d the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said in a statement in November. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a consumer in the country who hasn\u2019t had an experience with the unfair trading practices that we are planning to ban.\u201d A parliamentary inquiry into the live music sector delivered its final report last month. Included in the recommendations were the amendment of Australian consumer law to better regulate the selling of tickets to live music, by improving the transparency of fees and charges within the price of tickets and limiting the extreme variability in ticket prices caused by dynamic pricing. The inquiry also recommended the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) monitor the Australian music industry \u201cfor anti-competitive conduct and take enforcement action as required\u201d. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who sat on the parliamentary inquiry, said on Thursday: \u201cIn a cost-of-living crisis, it is outrageous to see big multinational companies ripping off live music fans and artists. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the big corporate players are making billions of dollars and we need to make sure that local artists, audiences and small-to-medium venues are getting a fair deal.\u201d The ACCC declined to comment on whether it had received any instructions from the government to look into alleged anti-competitive practices in the live music industry. Giving evidence at an inquiry hearing last July, the ACCC said it was closely following the anti-trust lawsuit the Department of Justice had launched against Live Nation in the US. A consumer behaviour academic at the University of NSW\u2019s business school, Prof Nitika Garg, said if dynamic pricing was outlawed in Australia the ACCC would have the power to examine ticketing companies\u2019 confidential data and pricing algorithms. \u201cBut there is nothing stopping them from doing it right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way to truly confirm it is happening is if somebody buys a seat in a particular section, and then somebody else buys a ticket in the same section at a much higher price later on. \u201cFrom a consumer perspective, dynamic pricing just adds another layer of consumer anxiety. \u201cNot only are they worried that they might not get seats by the time they are at the front of the queue, they also do not know what their financial outlay might be once they get there.\u201d",

        "headline": "From Drake\u2019s humiliation to Doechii\u2019s coronation: the talking points from the 2025 Grammys",
        "trailText": "Kendrick Lamar celebrated his rap beef victory in a \u2018Canadian tuxedo\u2019, Chappell Roan called out the industry and Nashville finally backed Beyonc\u00e9",
        "bodyText": "Drake was humiliated It\u2019s the kind of stress dream that pop stars tell their therapists about: \u201cMy artistic rival won record and song of the year at the Grammys for a track attacking me, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Even Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d And so it came to pass for Drake, seeing Kendrick Lamar win for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim \u2013 a \u201cCanadian tuxedo\u201d, no less \u2013 while half the arena seemed to chant \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably a minor\u201d, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn\u2019t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards \u2013 and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar \u2013 the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake? Chappell Roan called for workers\u2019 rights \u2026 For all her playfulness on stage and on record, there\u2019s also a seriousness of intent to Chappell Roan: part of the reason she\u2019s so loved is that she totally devotes herself to her craft, selling every line she sings. That\u2019s played out in her earnest politics, too, whether upbraiding a hectoring paparazzo, fretting about who to back (if anyone) in the US presidential race, and championing the rights of queer people and Palestinians. At the Grammys, she used the platform of a best new artist win to advocate for workers\u2019 rights, namely her fellow musicians, with a \u201cdemand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\u201d She spoke of struggling to afford health insurance in her early career, saying: \u201cIt was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised to not have health[care]. If my label would have prioritised artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to \u2026 Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d \u2026 and Lady Gaga for trans rights As Donald Trump enshrines transphobia in American law, Lady Gaga spoke out, saying: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d She was speaking after winning best pop duo/group performance for Die With a Smile, with Bruno Mars. Doechii capped her breakthrough year \u2026 Twenty-six-year-old rapper Doechii beat some of the most venerable, successful and respected MCs in the US \u2013 Eminem, Future, J Cole and the paired-up Common and Pete Rock \u2013 to win best rap album, only the third woman to win this category after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. This caps a stunning breakthrough over the past year, with jaws floored by the emphatically enunciated, elastically rhythmic raps on her album Alligator Bites Don\u2019t Heal, and then again by performances such as on Stephen Colbert\u2019s talkshow, her braided hair fused to that of her dancers. Her performance on the Grammys\u2019 stage was even stronger, a brilliantly choreographed strut through Denial Is a River where \u2013 with some expert help from her DJ, Miss Milan \u2013 she kept her flow going through high kicks, trust falls and a suit-busting bikini reveal. \u2026 as did Sierra Ferrell With her fourth album, Ferrell made a clean sweep of the roots and Americana categories, winning all four of the awards she was nominated for (in a less brutally competitive year, she would have got a best new artist nomination too). Dressed in one of the night\u2019s wackier outfits \u2013 think East End pearly queen after five rounds of AI enhancement, complete with sceptre \u2013 she\u2019s travelled a long way from the trailer-dwelling and freight train-hopping of her youth, to become a multimillion-streaming performer. As country and pop do-si-do ever more tightly, Ferrell, Zach Bryan and more are winning millions of fans drawn to a more authentic and analogue-sounding version of this vintage American music. Beyonc\u00e9 finally won album of the year She may have been the most-awarded star in history, but given the industry places such stock in the album format, Beyonc\u00e9 not winning that category felt like a big snub \u2013 particularly given her self-titled album lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase (not remotely the best album that year or in his own catalogue), while her great masterpiece 4 wasn\u2019t even nominated. So that wrong has now been righted. Some may be dismayed that it took a country album to do it, rather than an R&amp;B, pop or dance record \u2013 and Cowboy Carter has plenty of longueurs and even outright missteps. But it also contains some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most imaginative and beautiful music \u2013 the way Riverdance flows into II Hands II Heaven makes it the loveliest brace of songs on an album in her catalogue. Its bigger win in some ways is best country album, showing that Beyonc\u00e9 has convinced not just the broad pool of voters in the general field categories, but also the Nashville establishment who vote for the country awards. An American won best global music album Matt B, a little-streamed musician born and raised in Illinois and based in the US, beat representatives from Spain (Antonio Rey), Peru (Ciro Hurtado), and Nigeria (superstars Tems and Rema) to win best global music album for Alkebulan II, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. His album certainly creates a global dialogue, as he explores his African heritage with multilingual lyrics, lilting Afro-pop, and guests such as South African poet Nomfundo Khambule. But as the US enters its protectionist era under Trump, there may be some disquiet at this win. A multimillionare businesswoman won best new age album It\u2019s a shame that the great Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician who died of cancer aged 71 in 2023 having changed the face of his country\u2019s popular music, wasn\u2019t honoured in the category for best new age, ambient or chant album. His nominated LP Opus was full of his very particular piano style, full of chords that feel cautious and yet intentional, and where sentimentality is offset by chalky, dissonant notes. Instead, he lost to the little-heard Triveni by Wouter Kellerman, Eru Matsumoto and Chandrika Tandon, the latter a businesswoman and philanthropist (and sister of former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi) who worked for McKinsey before starting her own financial services firm. The Academy still loves Chris Stapleton He lost to Beyonc\u00e9 in the country album category, but Stapleton notched up his fifth win in 10 years in the best country solo performance category, a mark of how much the country-voting portion of the Recording Academy adores this artist, who pleases both staunch traditionalists while being relatively progressive \u2013 that\u2019s 11 wins overall for him now. It\u2019s a shame, though, that he won with a low-stakes ballad from the same album as his win last year, while shutting out Shaboozey\u2019s pop culturally dominant A Bar Song (Tipsy) in the process. Chris Brown was awarded Way after his notorious assault on Rihanna, Chris Brown has been accused of a long list of crimes against numerous women over the years, which he has denied \u2013 last week he sued over how he was represented in a new documentary, with lawyers saying: \u201cMr Brown has never been found guilty of any sex related crime \u2026 but this documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.\u201d His win for best R&amp;B album, over a big breakthrough by Muni Long and another veteran in Usher, plus others, shows that he still has his backers in the Recording Academy. But there has been disquiet online \u2013 just as there has for Kanye West\u2019s red carpet appearance with his wife, Bianca Censori essentially appearing nude, the latest in a series of mute, near-undressed appearances alongside him that have provoked widespread concern for her welfare. Female artists did well \u2013 but men still dominate behind the scenes Two of the \u201cbig four\u201d were won by female artists, but when you look into the actual winners, they were overwhelmingly male. These awards are shared by the producers, songwriters, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers and while there is some heartening female representation \u2013 such as Idania Valencia who mastered Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, and songwriters such as Elizabeth Lowell Boland and songwriter of the year winner Amy Allen \u2013 analysis by Akas found that only 9% of winners in the top four categories were women. And it was a bad night for the Brits Charli xcx was the chief British representative, and she gave an instantly viral bum-wiggling, underwear-chucking live performance of Guess on the night, but she was shut out of the big prizes, making do with dance-pop awards. And it wasn\u2019t a great night for other Brits. Belfast\u2019s Jordan Adetunji was beaten to the melodic rap prize by Rapsody and Erykah Badu, Raye lost out twice, while Jacob Collier\u2019s seventh win was a minor award, for arrangement. Instead we had to rely on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones for some face-saving wins, for best rock performance and album respectively (while Sean Ono Lennon also picked up an award, for co-creating the box set release of his father\u2019s album Mind Games). \u2022 This article was updated on 3 February with a correction: Beyonce\u2019s self-titled album, not Lemonade, lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase.",

        "trailText": "Despite Minnelli\u2019s memoir not being finished and a queue of \u2018Academy award, Emmy, Tony and Grammy winners excited to talk\u2019, the star of the upcoming biopic is already obvious",
        "bodyText": "As the repeatedly stalled Madonna biopic has shown, it\u2019s difficult to make a film about a real-life icon, especially when the icon in question has a say in who will play them. And so it might prove to be with Liza Minnelli. Earlier this year, Minnelli announced that she is writing what is sure to be a blockbuster memoir. The book promises to pull no punches which \u2013 when you factor in her parents, her addiction issues and her complicated love life \u2013 is a hell of a lot of punches not to pull. The book isn\u2019t due to come out until 2026. Despite this, the television rights have already been optioned and, even though it\u2019s so far in the distance, Minnelli has already got several ideas about casting. In an email to People magazine, she wrote: \u201cFirst, we need a great script and an actress who loves to move,\u201d adding, \u201cHoney, first, I\u2019m a dancer \u2026 like the great line in Chorus Line: God, I\u2019m a dancer \u2026 a dancer dances \u2026 even with replaced hips and scoliosis!\u201d Clearly, whoever does end up getting cast is almost certainly going to end up as an awards frontrunner, especially given that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger won an Oscar for playing her mother just five years ago. In the email, Minnelli hinted that the line was already starting to stretch around the block. \u201cWe\u2019re very grateful that Academy award, Emmy, Tony and Grammy winners are so excited to talk with us.\u201d Which seems like a polite way to say that it\u2019s definitely going to be Lady Gaga. Because of course it is. No actor in the world is hungrier for awards than Lady Gaga, which is why she kept giving that \u201cOne hundred people in a room,\u201d speech during her A Star Is Born campaign, and why she went so deeply method for House of Gucci that she wrote a letter to her own personality saying: \u201cI don\u2019t need you right now\u201d. A chance to play a world-class singer and generationally talented dancer who gets to emote her way through numerous traumas? This is the role that Lady Gaga has been waiting her entire life to play. What\u2019s more, they go back. In 2022, Gaga personally requested that Minnelli accompany her to present the best picture award at the Oscars. True, her appearance didn\u2019t go well \u2013 she looked so frail that she used the announcement of her autobiography to declare that the whole thing was \u201csabotaged\u201d \u2013 but Gaga still made time to tell her in front of the world that she was her biggest fan. Also Joker 2 was said to be heavily influenced by Liza Minnelli musicals, but maybe let\u2019s not dwell on that. One potential issue with the Gaga casting is age. From the People email, it sounds like the adaptation of the memoir will focus on Minnelli\u2019s later years. It will, she wrote, be \u201cthe story of an SUD [substance use disorder] victor not victim, who happens to be closing in on age 80,\u201d because that would be \u201ca first for the screen\u201d. Still, the biopic wouldn\u2019t be released for a number of years, and there are plenty of options open. Realistically, you wouldn\u2019t want to make a film about Liza Minnelli unless you could include scenes from her golden years, so perhaps Gaga could be drafted in for flashbacks. Similarly, the biopic could pull a reverse Irishman and age Gaga by several decades for the newer scenes \u2013 hopefully the technology is advancing quickly enough that the final result wouldn\u2019t automatically give everyone the creeps. And then, of course, there are prosthetics. The best thing by far about Bradley Cooper\u2019s Maestro was the absurdly realistic old age makeup used to help him play Leonard Bernstein in his later years. It could be worth suggesting that this is what the producers should go for. So it is decided. Despite the possibly intentional vagueness, Lady Gaga is almost certainly going to play Liza Minnelli in the near future. It\u2019s all but a done deal. Now, the real question is: how do we convince Bradley Cooper to play David Gest?",

        "trailText": "The Drag Race Down Under finalist shares what makes her laugh, from Cole Escola deep cuts to twisted stoner comedy, immaculate drag and the best lip-sync performance ever",
        "bodyText": "I am Lazy Susan from Drag Race Down Under, and I have a confession: this article is the pinnacle of my career \u2013 everything I have ever aspired to. After this moment, nothing else will compare. For years, I\u2019ve been a devoted fan of the Guardian\u2019s 10 funniest things column: sometimes finding joy, sometimes critiquing the mediocre taste of people more successful than me, but always captivated by its unique insight into the human mind. During many long nights as I toiled away in lipstick-sodden obscurity, I would gaze at the sky and dream of the day I\u2019d finally have the chance to write my own list of 10 things. Now, riding the wave of newfound celebrity \u2013 ascending to a status reserved only for the likes of TikTok comedians, Fboys, and Muster Dogs \u2013 I can finally say it: I am Lazy Susan, and THESE are the funniest things from the internet. 1. Lady Gaga: Volantis In 2013, Lady Gaga commissioned the world\u2019s first flying dress, Volantis. She took her maiden voyage inside a Brooklyn warehouse to coincide with the release of her album ArtPop. This was Lady Gaga at the height of her hubris \u2013 the moment before everything began to unravel. While Icarus was punished by the fates for flying too high, Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was punished for flying too low. The sound of her \u201cflying dress\u201d scraping along a concrete floor for several meters, in front of a sea of New York press and glitterati, is one of the funniest things in the world. This video is perfection. 2. Hot Department: My Mum Makes Me Milo It\u2019s almost gauche to point out that Hot Department is funny at this stage. They are spectacular and are about to become far too famous for their own good. They are at their best when they are at their most absurd \u2013 which is, thankfully, 100% of the time. Please enjoy this Milo ad. 3. Lady Red Couture sings Rich White Woman Lady Red Couture is a drag legend who served as the sidekick on the drag talk show Hey Qween for many years. This is her song Rich White Woman, in which she imagines herself as, well, a rich white woman. This is the highest form of drag. It\u2019s cutting, filled with a deep rage that\u2019s paved over by sequins and a smile. Losing Lady Red in 2020 was devastating, but she will always be an icon. 4. Jenny Slate in Catherine The story I heard about this show is that it was born when very stoned comedians were challenging each other to act like \u201cnormal people\u201d. What resulted was Catherine, a story in 12 parts. I don\u2019t want to spoil this, but Jenny Slate and Dean Fleischer Camp have created one of the most twisted pieces of internet storytelling that exists. I watch this in its entirety every six months, and it never fails to leave me heaving with laughter. 5. Cole Escola\u2019s Pee Pee Manor Before their breakout turn on Broadway with Oh, Mary!, Cole Escola was putting out some of the best content YouTube has ever seen. Pee Pee Manor is a pilot for an imaginary show that feels like Twin Peaks\u2019 weird gay stepson. It\u2019s no wonder Cole has become one of the comedic voices defining our generation. 6. Jenny Nicholson reviews the Hallmark YouTube channel If you\u2019ve spent any time on the internet in the last few years, you know who Jenny Nicholson is. She\u2019s a culture critic who takes deep dives into obscure corners of the internet, generally with some kind of numbered list (familiar). This video takes us into the six videos created for the Hallmark YouTube channel in their bid to create fun online content. As a former social creative who made slurry content for big brands, this is triggering \u2013 and so satisfying. If Carl Sagan ever made another golden record to send into space to represent this moment in human history, I\u2019d nominate this video. 7. Coco Peru plays Grand Theft Auto Let me ask you a question: have you ever watched a drag queen play Grand Theft Auto? Coco Peru is easily one of the funniest drag performers of all time. She embodies everything I aspire to be. Once you\u2019ve finished this, seek out her performance in the absolutely savage film Girls Will Be Girls (2003). 8. Kimya Dawson: Mariah and the Haunted Forest Folk musician Kimya Dawson tells the story of working in a haunted corn maze in her home town when Mariah Carey comes to visit. This story is equal parts funny and heartbreaking. So much of what I find funny has a deep rage running beneath it, and I love how petty and angry this story is. 9. Ruby Rai P.I. Someone at ABC needs to get fired for not turning this Fresh Blood project into a series. Vidya Rajan, who co-created this short, is such an exciting voice in the Australian comedy landscape. Her work is whimsical, biting, and so smart. When so much contemporary comedy feels self-consciously derivative, Vidya insists on creating idiosyncratic pieces of art. Give her a show already! 10. Bob the Drag Queen \u2013 Celine Dion lip-sync This is the best lip-sync performance ever. Point blank. Bob is immaculate, and her control of the form is unmatched. Without any props or theatrical effects, she creates a whole world for this song. If you\u2019re considering starting drag, this is the performance you should study. Drag Race Down Under season four season finale premieres Friday 20 December at 5pm on Stan. Listen to Lazy Susan and Zelda Moon\u2019s podcast Death To Everyone wherever you get your podcasts.",

        "headline": "One in four Britons victim of ticket scams for in-demand events, says Nationwide",
        "trailText": "Building society makes warning to fans desperate not to miss out as resale for Glastonbury festival approaches",
        "bodyText": "One in four Britons say they have fallen victim to a ticket scam involving an in-demand event and lost \u00a382 each on average, according to research issued ahead of the official Glastonbury festival ticket resale. High demand and low availability, fuelled by \u201cfomo\u201d (fear of missing out), were creating a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for scammers, said Nationwide building society, which commissioned the analysis. It made the warning as thousands \u2013 and potentially millions \u2013 of music fans gear up for a second chance to secure entry to this year\u2019s Glastonbury after the bulk of the tickets sold out in 35 minutes in November. A resale of what could be several thousand cancelled and returned tickets is expected to take place within the next fortnight \u2013 last year it was on 18 and 21 April \u2013 and demand could be even higher than usual as next year will be a fallow year, meaning there will be no festival , to allow the site to recover. During the last year or so, several high-profile events created a clamour for tickets, triggering a spate of scams. Months before Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour had even reached UK shores last summer, British fans were estimated to have lost more than \u00a31m after tickets went on sale. Oasis fans who fell victim to scammers in their desperation to secure tickets to the Manchester band\u2019s UK reunion shows this summer lost \u00a3346 each on average, according to a Lloyds bank analysis of its own data. There have also been warnings that fans of Lady Gaga will be targeted after tickets for her forthcoming UK arena tour went on sale on Thursday. Lloyds bank has previously said more than 90% of reported cases started with fake adverts or posts on social media, and they usually involve people being tricked into sending money via bank transfer. However, many people do not report the crime, often because they are embarrassed about falling victim to a con, or in some cases because the amount involved was relatively small. The research by Nationwide found that just over half (51%) of those polled would consider buying tickets from \u201cquestionable sources\u201d to avoid missing out, increasing their chances of falling victim to fraud. More than a fifth (22%) were \u201cprepared to pay extra due to fomo\u201d. Those aged 25-34 were the most vulnerable to being scammed. Two in five (40%) of this age group \u201cwould knowingly risk buying fake tickets\u201d to secure a spot, said Nationwide. Jim Winters, Nationwide\u2019s director of economic crime, said: \u201cWhen offered high-demand tickets that are cheap, or even just available, fans can easily lose control of their senses as their hearts rule their heads.\u201d",

        "trailText": "Writer-director shows support for critically maligned and commercially disastrous musical follow-up to 2019 hit",
        "bodyText": "Quentin Tarantino has come out in support of the critical and commercial flop Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux. The writer-director sang the musical sequel\u2019s praises during a recent appearance on Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s podcast. The Todd Phillips-directed follow-up to his 2019 hit Joker scored a 32% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cI really, really liked it, really,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot. Like, tremendously, and I went to see it expecting to be impressed by the film-making but I thought it was going to be an arms-length, intellectual exercise that ultimately I wouldn\u2019t think worked like a movie, but that I would appreciate it for what it is. And I\u2019m just nihilistic enough to kind of enjoy a movie that doesn\u2019t quite work as a movie or that\u2019s like a big, giant mess to some degree. And I didn\u2019t find it an intellectual exercise. I really got caught up into it.\u201d Tarantino added that Joaquin Phoenix gave \u201cone of the best performances I\u2019ve ever seen in my life\u201d and that the film offered the version of Natural Born Killers that he \u201cwould have dreamed of seeing\u201d. Tarantino\u2019s original script for the Oliver Stone-directed satire was drastically rewritten back in the 1990s. He also praised Phillips. \u201cThe Joker directed the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cThe entire concept, even him spending the studio\u2019s money \u2013 he\u2019s spending it like the Joker would spend it, all right? \u2026 He\u2019s saying fuck you to all of them. He\u2019s saying fuck you to the movie audience. He\u2019s saying fuck you to Hollywood.\u201d The Pulp Fiction auteur called it a \u201creally funny\u201d film and said that he \u201creally liked the musical sequences\u201d. The $200m-budgeted film premiered at this year\u2019s Venice film festival to negative reviews and went on to make less than $60m in the US and $201m to date. The 2019 original made $335m in the US and more than $1bn worldwide. The film was also praised by Francis Ford Coppola, who is grappling with his own box office flop in Megalopolis. \u201cEver since the wonderful The Hangover, he\u2019s always been one step ahead of the audience never doing what they expect. Congratulations to Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. Paul Schrader, whose screenplay Taxi Driver served as inspiration for the first film, was less taken with it. \u201cI saw about 10 or 15 minutes of it,\u201d he said to Interview magazine. \u201cI left, bought something, came back, saw another 10 minutes. That was enough.\u201d",

        "trailText": "It\u2019s tough to call the quality-stacked top categories, featuring Academy darlings such as Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift alongside pop\u2019s new tyros",
        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink). Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best country solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 16 Carriages Jelly Roll \u2013 I Am Not Okay Kacey Musgraves \u2013 The Architect Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Chris Stapleton \u2013 It Takes a Woman In a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by either Chris Stapleton or Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "trailText": "This year\u2019s nominations were led by smaller, less expected films like The Brutalist, Anora and Emilia P\u00e9rez, which left bigger bets in the cold",
        "bodyText": "While films such as Wicked and Dune: Part Two amassed multiple Oscar nominations this year, the Academy\u2019s ongoing embrace of the smaller, less conventional movie pushed a number of more traditional contenders out. From the long-awaited sequel to a best picture winner to an inspirational boxing drama to a music biopic starring an Oscar favourite, here are some of the more primed picks that failed to register: The Fire Inside On the same day at last year\u2019s Toronto film festival, two rousing sports dramas premiered, both based on true stories and both released by Amazon. The wrestling pic Unstoppable might have had the edge at the time, thanks to a better-positioned slot and the headlines created by its star Jennifer Lopez, but it was the Barry Jenkins-penned boxing saga The Fire Inside that ultimately won out with critics. Yet the film, based on the incredible story of the Olympic champion Claressa Shields, couldn\u2019t break through the end-of-year scrum with audiences or voters. The previous best supporting actor nominee Brian Tyree Henry, who plays her coach, should have been a shoo-in to repeat in that same category but he was unfairly ignored, reflecting a shift in the Academy\u2019s move away from sports films and also a campaign that lacked the necessary aggression. Gladiator II It had appeared for a brief while that Ridley Scott\u2019s long-awaited Gladiator sequel would be a major player during awards season. Not only had the original won five Oscars, including best picture, but early word on his follow-up was positive enough to have some speculating that it could finally be the three-time nominee\u2019s time to win best director. But the more that people saw it, the less that felt likely and each potential nomination started falling away, from Paul Mescal to Scott to the film itself to, finally, even Denzel Washington, who was seen as the film\u2019s last hope. It ended up with just one nod, for best costume design, the blockbuster best picture slots swallowed up by Wicked and Dune: Part Two. Blitz Things had seemed perfectly aligned for Blitz on paper: the director Steve McQueen, who had been embraced by the Academy for his powerful 2013 best picture winner 12 Years a Slave, making a film about the London Blitz recruiting the four-time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan. But the film, which was an unusual world premiere at the usually world premiere-light London film festival, couldn\u2019t quite distinguish itself in the year\u2019s busiest period with polite rather than enthused reviews and a confusing release strategy from Apple that made it unclear when it was out and how it could be seen. The streamer\u2019s award wins (CODA, Killers of the Flower Moon) are starting to be outnumbered by their losses (Blitz joins Emancipation, Napoleon and Flora and Son). Maria The director Pablo Larra\u00edn seemed to have found the perfect formula for securing his lead female actors an Oscar nomination: cast them in an unconventional biopic of a famous and famously misunderstood woman. It worked for Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy in Jackie and then Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana in Spencer but his luck ran out with Angelina Jolie as Maria Callas in Maria, the film scoring just one Oscar nod for best cinematography. Jolie had originally been in the conversation, scoring herself a Golden Globe nomination, but the film didn\u2019t quite have the momentum. It was an awkward fit for buyer Netflix, a withholding drama following a figure less known to the average viewer and Jolie\u2019s comeback narrative ultimately didn\u2019t have the same appeal as that of Demi Moore. The Piano Lesson After the success of Fences, which helped to end the #OscarsSoWhite embarrassment of the previous two years with a win for Viola Davis and three other nominations, Netflix found success with another August Wilson adaptation, Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom. It won two Oscars (for costume design and makeup and hairstyling) and had another three nominations, making yet another Wilson movie seem like an easy win. The Piano Lesson premiered at last year\u2019s Telluride film festival to positive reviews and early buzz for Danielle Deadwyler, who had been unfairly snubbed for her role in Till, suggested she would be a surefire best supporting actress contender. But despite a few other shreds of recognition (Sag and Critics Circle noms) she missed out on another deserved Oscar nod and the film, despite being arguably the most visually expansive and well-crafted of the three adaptations, didn\u2019t even score any technical nods. It was another swing and miss for Netflix. Shirley There was barely a swing made by Netflix for this one, a long-delayed biopic of Shirley Chisholm that was demoted earlier in the year. There had been an understandable race to transfer Chisholm\u2019s incredible story, as the first Black woman to run for US president, to the screen with Viola Davis and Danai Gurira attached to different projects and in 2021, it was announced that the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave screenwriter John Ridley would be developing a project with the Oscar winner Regina King starring. By the end of the year filming began but after reports of underwhelming test screenings the following year, an easy-on-paper Oscar play for the streamer was then shelved for the next two years and released in the spring of an election year to mixed reviews. King\u2019s next role, in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s crime thriller Caught Stealing, should bring her more of the attention she deserves. Lee After six nominations and one win, Kate Winslet\u2019s name was never going to be too far away from the Oscars and this year, after two Golden Globe nominations (one of them for television), she was again in the race. But her role in the rather boringly conventional war biopic Lee wasn\u2019t enough to include her name in the final five, the kind of performance in the kind of film that might have had more of an impact 20 years ago. She had some last-minute help from her Titanic co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and the recent Oscars queenmaker Frances Fisher (who helped to steer Andrea Riseborough to a controversial best actress nod) but the film, which premiered at Toronto back in 2023, just didn\u2019t have enough critical support. Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux A sequel to a DC Comics movie would not be typically expected to gain Oscar recognition outside of technical nods but then 2019\u2019s Joker didn\u2019t operate in a traditional way. After its unusual Venice premiere, it insisted its way into the conversation for the next few months whether we liked it or not, scoring Oscars for its score and the actor Joaquin Phoenix along with another nine nominations, another landmark moment for comic book adaptations after Black Panther broke through a few years before. The stage was set for a repeat with the sequel getting another Venice bow and an Oscar-nominated co-star in Lady Gaga but Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux emerged with its middle finger up, a defiant semi-musical uninterested in giving anyone what they expected, including the Academy who shunned it in the same way that both critics and fans had. Will &amp; Harper Last year\u2019s Sundance brought the kind of old-fashioned crowd-pleasing magic the festival was once known for: laughs, tears and cheers for Will Ferrell\u2019s heartfelt road trip documentary Will &amp; Harper. The film, which saw the actor travel across the US with his trans friend Harper Steele, ticked off the traditional feelgood boxes while also bringing something more contemporary and politically urgent in its plea to treat a maligned group with some humanity. Netflix paid a large sum for it and gave it a robust awards campaign but the doc branch have been resisting both films featuring celebrities (in the last six years the only nominee that would fall into this category would be Summer of Soul) and films from the US in general. Even the novelty submission of Kristen Wiig\u2019s theme song couldn\u2019t break through. Here The surprise success of Robert Zemeckis\u2019s Forrest Gump ($678m at the global box office, six Oscar wins) led to the inevitable question of a sequel. The book it was based on did spawn a follow-up and in 2001, a draft was put together by the original screenwriter, Eric Roth, but he submitted it on 10 September 2001 and after the next day\u2019s tragedy, it was felt that it had \u201cno meaning\u201d any more. Three decades later and Zemeckis, Roth and stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright reunited for something else, something that ended up feeling even less necessary than Forrest Gump 2. Here, an adaptation of Richard McGuire\u2019s graphic novel, was another Zemeckis tech gimmick \u2013 the same room, from the same angle over time \u2013 and like his other recent films, it sank without a trace, not even a visual effects nod in sight.",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight. I don\u2019t think she hates to say it at all. LS",
