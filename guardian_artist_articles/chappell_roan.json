        "bodyText": "It\u2019s easy to forget that in the year that Chappell Roan became one of the world\u2019s biggest pop stars, she only released one single. Good Luck, Babe! came out in April 2024, precipitating the explosion of the US pop star as a live phenomenon who made pop hyper fun and queer again, while also remaining strikingly principled about how far she was willing to go for her art. When streaming demands that pop stars pebbledash releases in order to stay buoyant on playlists, her disinclination to capitalise on Good Luck, Babe!\u2019s success with more material is reflective of Roan\u2019s confidence in her way of doing things, whether persisting with a vision that her previous label rejected \u2013 and being totally vindicated for it \u2013 or using her recent Grammys win to call for labels to provide musicians with proper healthcare. The tactic has paid off: in the absence of new songs, Pink Pony Club \u2013 the song Atlantic dropped her over \u2013 reached UK No 1 last week, almost five years after its original release. Her debut album, 2023\u2019s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, has been in the UK Top 10 since June, taking two separate weeks at No 1. You wonder if releasing a new song almost risks disturbing that reign. Roan has been teasing two new tracks live for a while \u2013 lovelorn ballad Subway and The Giver, a gay-as-hell country song debuted when she performed on Saturday Night Live in November. Now officially released, the latter is a rowdy deviation from Roan\u2019s regular pure-pop melodrama, full of whoops and giddy fiddle solos reminiscent of the (Dixie) Chicks\u2019 massive 90s hits. Roan schemes, once more, about how she\u2019s gonna get the girl: not quite as delirious as Hot to Go! or Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl, but still riotous good fun. A cynic might suggest that going country really is a risk-averse move: everyone from Beyonc\u00e9 to Dumfries-born Calvin Harris has done it recently, nakedly lunging for a bite at Nashville\u2019s commercial dominance. (So dominant that the sound has even penetrated the historically country-averse UK.) But Roan grew up in Missouri surrounded by country music, and she took the Roan part of her stage name from her late grandfather\u2019s favourite western song, The Strawberry Roan. \u201cI can\u2019t call myself the midwest princess and not acknowledge country music straight up,\u201d she said recently. Plus, she added: \u201cI just think a lesbian country song is really funny, so I wrote that.\u201d Roan felt encouraged to lean into her outre persona after witnessing a transformative drag show at a Hollywood gay bar, and she considers herself a drag act: no one is better placed to skewer and celebrate the high-camp inherent in country, which runs on equally hammed-up performances of gender and so-called authenticity. In the promotional imagery for the single, she\u2019s dressed in the attire of various working-class professions. \u201cI get the job done,\u201d she sings in a chorus made for country-booted twirling, the job in hand being satisfying a woman better than \u201cno country boy quitter\u201d ever could. In one satisfied wink, she punctures fantasies of masculine primacy, as well as skewering how political charlatans exploit blue-collar folksiness for personal gain. She offers up much a better fantasy: \u201cHow I look is how I touch,\u201d a fairly ecstatic notion to conjure with given Roan\u2019s usual wild, rococo costuming: no haphazard lick and a promise here.",

        "trailText": "The singer castigated record labels in her Grammys speech \u2013 but, as music industry insiders explain, issues around artist health and support run even deeper",
        "bodyText": "At this year\u2019s Grammys, as she accepted the award for best new artist, Chappell Roan made an appeal to the labels and industry reps in the audience to \u201coffer a liveable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists\u201d \u2013 and in so doing, heated up long-simmering tensions in the music industry over artists\u2019 wellbeing and remuneration. Roan said that after she was dropped by Atlantic Records, a subsidiary of Warner, in the 2010s, she had little real-world job experience and \u201ccould not afford health insurance\u201d. She added that \u201cit was devastating to \u2026 feel so betrayed by the system\u201d. She is now signed to Island, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group (UMG), and her speech seemed to be addressed specifically to major labels, whose profits have soared in recent years even as revenue for artists has gone down. Musicians including Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx and Noah Kahan have backed her, each matching a $25,000 donation she made to the music mental-health charity Backline, but her speech was also met with a scathing op-ed by Jeff Rabhan, a former chair of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in New York, who called her comments misguided. His piece was widely maligned, but was symptomatic of an industry fretting at the prospect of its longstanding labour practices being revolutionised by artists. Stories of overwork, poor mental health and precarious contracts are common among artists; fresh concern over pastoral care has been triggered by the drug-related death of the singer Liam Payne, who was dropped by his label amid his addiction struggles. Jillian Banks \u2013 AKA pop musician Banks \u2013 found success in the major-label system with her first two albums in the mid-2010s, and says that, as a major-label signee you are \u201cnot really viewed as a sensitive human that creates art \u2013 you\u2019re now a product, and so they are viewing everything through the lens of trying to make you make money for them\u201d. She describes the label-mandated schedule she had to adhere to early in her career as \u201cessentially inhumane \u2013 it was every day, interviews and shoots all day long, flying here and there \u2026 if you said you weren\u2019t OK with it, there was always some sort of backlash\u201d. Eventually, she had to begin cancelling promotional opportunities because of burnout. Joey DeFrancesco, co-founder of the United Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) group, says that labels \u201cshould certainly be providing benefits\u201d like healthcare to artists such as those in the development stages of their career. \u201c[Those artists] are often signing contracts where the artist is working for this label in an extremely full-time capacity \u2013 the label is providing the PR, the booking agents, all these parts of a musician\u2019s life, so the artist is very much working for that label,\u201d he says. \u201cIn such circumstances where you\u2019re working full-time for an employer, the employer is supposed to give you benefits. But so often what happens is that employers intentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors or freelancers, not technically employees under legal definition, [so they] don\u2019t give them benefits.\u201d Musicians signed to UMG, Sony Music Entertainment (SME) and Warner Music Group (WMG) \u2013 the \u201cbig three\u201d major labels \u2013 and their subsidiaries qualify for insurance through the Sag-Aftra union throughout the period that they are signed with the label. UMG and SME also have partnerships with the Music Health Alliance (MHA), a non-profit organisation that provides musicians with healthcare advocacy and support at no cost. (In some cases, this may be offering assistance in applying for Medicaid.) Last week, UMG announced a further partnership with MHA called the Music Industry Mental Health Fund for UMG artists and the broader industry. It\u2019s certainly necessary: the UK mental-health charity Mind says that musicians are up to three times more likely to suffer from depression than non-musicians, owing to the insecure nature of their income, pressure from fans and labels, and access to alcohol and drugs. (Representatives from UMG and SME declined to comment on the record; reps for WMG were not immediately available for comment.) This coverage does not account for Roan\u2019s appeal for broader artist support, including for those who may be tied up in development deals that ultimately result in contract termination. David Airaudi, manager of indie-pop star Steve Lacy and author of forthcoming artist handbook Made Art, says \u201cThere [have] to be systems in place to take care of the artists that drive our business,\u201d but that \u201cwe\u2019ve gotten so far away from that over the years.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s profits over people \u2013 when you put for-profit entities in charge of products that are the result of human suffering, trial, toil and soul, you\u2019re going to get a disconnect,\u201d he says. Airaudi says that putting the onus on labels to provide this kind of support shifts focus away from an industry-wide problem, in which overstuffed touring schedules can become \u201cincredibly taxing\u201d, resulting in mental-health issues; and where managers don\u2019t always teach financial literacy to their artists. Globally, there are pushes being made for fairer artist compensation. Following Roan\u2019s Grammys speech, the UK songwriting group Ivors Academy announced plans to lobby for better treatment of songwriters, including label-funded daily expenses, minimum royalty cuts from master recordings to songwriters, and more. Early last year, Rashida Tlaib and Jamaal Bowman introduced a bill to the US Congress called the Living Wage for Musicians Act, which would require streaming services to introduce a subscription fee that would go directly to artists and to put a percentage of non-subscription revenue into a new royalty fund which would pay out directly to musicians. (UMAW worked on the bill with Tlaib and Bowman.) Earlier this week, industry executive Troy Carter \u2013 an early manager of Lady Gaga \u2013 pledged on Instagram that his label, Venice, would write healthcare stipends into its contracts, although it\u2019s unclear whether Venice has any signees or operates beyond distribution services. Both DeFrancesco and Airaudi say that there will always be musicians who fall through the cracks of any industry-wide pushes for healthcare, and that ultimately such initiatives are stopgaps for a country without a centrally funded national health service. \u201cThe vast majority of UMAW members are not on major labels,\u201d says DeFrancesco. \u201cWe need musicians, like all workers, to be demanding better healthcare from their employers, but also getting organised politically to defend the Medicaid that we have right now and then expand it further into that single payer system.\u201d In the meantime, says Banks, major labels don\u2019t seem willing to budge on their treatment of musicians. \u201cThe way the culture is set up, it\u2019s kind of about quantity over quality, where everything\u2019s about money and a major label can sign an artist for one song, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, let\u2019s move on to the next,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they were to actually develop artists, they would have to invest in healthcare.\u201d",

        "trailText": "Language experts rounded up the year\u2019s winners (losers?) in the US and UK \u2013 and provided the correct pronunciations",
        "bodyText": "At the Democratic national convention, Kamala Harris\u2019s nieces explained how to pronounce Harris\u2019s name. Chappell Roan gave fans a friendly \u201cfinal warning\u201d about the pronunciation of hers. And Zendaya settled the matter on video. All three helped to define 2024 \u2013 and spent the year hearing people get their names wrong: each appears on lists of the year\u2019s most mispronounced words in the US and UK, produced by the language-learning website Babbel, which reminds us that they\u2019re pronounced COM-a-la HAR-iss, CHAP-uhl ROHN and Zen-DAY-a. The lists, created with the closed-captioning and subtitling companies the Captioning Group and the British Institute of Verbatim Reporters, show the stars in good company: among the other mispronounced names and words are Barry Keoghan (BARR-ee key-OH-gin, with a hard g), the Irish actor and star of Saltburn, and Pete Buttigieg (Boot-Edge-Edge), the US transportation secretary. But it wasn\u2019t just humans whose names were mispronounced. Among this year\u2019s other list-makers: The Dutch Kooikerhondje (COY-ker-HUND-che), a breed of dog owned by the world\u2019s best baseball player, Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ohtani\u2019s dog won fans after \u201cthrowing\u201d the first pitch at a game (he carried the ball from the pitcher\u2019s mound to his crouching owner at home plate). Shein, the fast-fashion site \u2013 it\u2019s SHE-in, not SHEEN or SHINE. The drug in the weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy is semaglutide (sem-ah-GLOO-tide). Phryge, the mascot of the Paris Olympics and summer Paralympics, is pronounced FREE-je. It was a nod to the Phrygian cap, an emblematic accessory of the French revolutionaries. The flygskam (FLEEG-skam) \u2013 or flight-shame \u2013 movement is pushing people to cut down on flying to help the planet. Also in the word of professional sports: Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol (YOSH-ko GVAR-dee-ol) plays soccer (FOOT-ball) for Manchester City and Croatia. And the mispronunciation of the word espresso (es-PRESS-oh) as ex-PRESS-oh sparked outrage among some coffee fans. The word has been in the news thanks to the song by Sabrina Carpenter, who also made headlines for her relationship with Keoghan. Why all the mispronunciation? Blame it, in part, on the Norman invasion of 1066. English spelling is incredibly confusing thanks to the ways it has combined other languages, says Nicole Holliday, acting associate professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. On top of that, there\u2019s the linguistic \u201cinstability\u201d that comes from the democratization of news. If one person mispronounces a name in a video for their thousands of TikTok followers, it can have a knock-on effect. That\u2019s probably not so new. \u201cI imagine before TV news, there were people saying politicians\u2019 names all kinds of wild ways,\u201d having only read them in the newspaper, Holliday says. Finally, there\u2019s the phenomenon of words becoming what Holliday describes as \u201cshibboleths\u201d \u2013 in this case, words that can distinguish an in-group from an out-group. That certainly seems to be the case for Harris, whose name was mispronounced by almost half the speakers at the Republican national convention this summer \u2013 getting it wrong showed you were aligned with Donald Trump, who said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d about getting it right. But shibboleths can extend beyond politics: pronouncing your favorite celebrity\u2019s name in a certain way, for instance, might indicate that you\u2019re a real fan. Meanwhile, as with any list of words of the year, the document offers a look back, Esteban Touma, of Babbel, told the Associated Press. As Roan\u2019s music gained popularity over the year, it was an interesting cultural moment to watch as people learned to pronounce her name, he said. \u201cThe way we create understanding with each other is just trying to do these things,\u201d Touma said.

        "bodyText": "Chappell Roan, the year\u2019s breakout pop star, is to headline Reading and Leeds festival next year. The drag-indebted US songwriter had one of the biggest songs of the year in Good Luck, Babe! and her debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released in 2023, has spent 24 consecutive weeks in the UK Top 10. Her performance is an English headline exclusive. She is joined by fellow Reading and Leeds first-time headliners Hozier, the Irish songwriter who scored his first UK No 1 album last year with Unreal Unearth, and US rapper Travis Scott, whose 2023 album Utopia is certified gold in the UK (100,000 units sold) and platinum (1,000,000) in the US. His performance is a European exclusive. Sheffield metal band Bring Me the Horizon complete the lineup. They previously headlined the festival in 2022. Last year, member Jordan Fish quit the group to pursue a career in production. Their latest album, Post Human: Nex Gen, received a five-star review from the Guardian, which called it \u201ca defining album of our digitally overloaded era\u201d. Both Hozier and Bring Me the Horizon are UK festival exclusives. Further down the bill are the rappers AJ Tracey, Blanco, Trippie Redd, Antony Szmierek and Lancey Foux; rock bands Enter Shikari, Amyl and the Sniffers, Good Kid, Soft Play, High Vis, Wallows, Sea Girls, Royel Otis, the Linda Lindas, Lambrini Girls, the Chats and Mannequin Pussy; indie-pop acts Wunderhorse, Conan Gray, Sofia Isella, Alessi Rose, Bilmuri, Suki Waterhouse, Nieve Ella, Luvcat, Lola Young and Del Water Gap; dance stars Becky Hill, Sammy Virji, DJ EZ, Issey Cross, Girls Don\u2019t Sync and Rudim3ntal; indie mainstays the Kooks and Bloc Party \u2013 plus indie sleaze revivalists the Dare and Snow Strippers; and K-pop band Balming Tiger. Melvin Benn, the managing director of Festival Republic, which runs Reading and Leeds, said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re witnessing an exciting wave of inspiring voices breaking through in pop culture, and this lineup captures that energy perfectly. This is one of the youngest average ages for headliners in years, and that\u2019s very exciting in itself.\u201d Reading takes place at Richfield Avenue; Leeds at Bramham Park. Both events take place 21-24 August 2025. The general presale opens at noon on 7 December, and the general sale at noon on 9 December.",

        "trailText": "Whether you\u2019re a parent or not, you should be able to talk candidly about how tough it is having kids",
        "bodyText": "A few weeks ago I told my friend \u2013 a good friend \u2013 that I was considering having a third kid. The colour washed from her face, and before her filter could kick in she said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d She corrected herself. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to, do you?\u201d I realised she thought I was unhappy. She thought I regretted it all. She was wrong on both accounts, but I didn\u2019t blame her for coming to such a stark conclusion. That friend was not Chappell Roan. But the pop star is being pelted with the internet equivalent of soiled nappies for saying \u201call [her] friends who have kids are in hell\u201d and \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s happy with children at her age\u201d. The Pink Pony Club singer also said on Alex Cooper\u2019s Call Her Daddy podcast that: \u201cI literally have not met anyone [with young kids] who\u2019s happy \u2013 anyone who has like light in their eyes, anyone who has slept.\u201d God, what has she done? But I owe it to the one person besides Imogen Heap whose music can put my six-month-old to sleep in the car to mount some sort of defence here. Sure, she might be wrong about the \u201chappy\u201d part. So many parents are knee deep in chaos while being somehow simultaneously over the moon. But if in between winning awards and touring she\u2019s managed a whirlwind trip to her home town, I\u2019m not shocked she\u2019s been left with the thought that her friends with young kids are in hell. I so viscerally remember the fight or flight instinct in my friends\u2019 eyes when I had my first baby and was spiralling. As I whinged, I could see they didn\u2019t get the insane dichotomy that was my postpartum mental state. I was so happy, but so drained. I was elated, but exhausted. I was in love, but crying \u2026 again. And I needed to whinge. I would have happily done a Ted Talk on how my kids slept. Those three little dots typing in the mum\u2019s group WhatsApp? Me. There are few things more cathartic for a new parent than a good whinge; an expulsion of what we\u2019re wading through, just to remind ourselves it\u2019s a slog. Roan\u2019s comments have unsurprisingly made a lot of mums angry on TikTok. But to me the comments reveal the Grammy-winning artist is simply a good friend who has listened to her friends as they navigate the perils of early parenthood. I so hope she sat on a yoghurt-stained couch while her friends vented about sleepless nights and the cost of blueberries. If she\u2019s been blasted with the timeless tales of parenting \u2013 or seen it with her own eyes \u2013 and assumed her friends were unhappy, then great. That\u2019s probably an understandable conclusion, even if it might not be the right one. The fact she\u2019s gone a step further and thought \u201cnah, not for me\u201d; well, that\u2019s inspiring. Not only does Roan appear to be a good listener, the comments show a reassuring amount of empathy. Especially for someone who is a role model to young kids. She went on to say she didn\u2019t know why her own parents did it. It took me 29 years \u2013 two years longer than Roan at 27 \u2013 for the thought to even cross my mind. This is an era where we can and should be able to talk candidly about how tough having kids is; whether you\u2019re a parent or not. I\u2019m four months out from finishing parental leave, and I\u2019m convinced this very well could be the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. But it\u2019s also tide-marked by moments of absolute, inconceivable hell. And the light in my eyes? It wavers from nonexistent to a euphoric glow. The dramatic yo-yos of parenthood feel impossible to describe, but if Chappell ever wants to come over and hear about it, my couch is filthy and waiting.

        "bodyText": "The BBC Sound of 2025 list, the broadcaster\u2019s annual list of rising artists with \u201cthe best chance of mainstream success\u201d, has highlighted a number of acts with a great deal of mainstream success already under their belts. Arguably, the US pop star Chappell Roan has been the sound of 2024. She released her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, in September 2023, and a subsequent non-album single, Good Luck, Babe!, was released in April 2024 and peaked at No 2 in the UK. Viral footage of her high-camp performances has made her one of the year\u2019s defining stars, and she was recently nominated for six Grammys. Australian band Confidence Man recently released their third album, 3AM (La La La), and have been a regular draw at festivals worldwide for some time. Leeds group English Teacher won this year\u2019s Mercury prize; London jazz ensemble Ezra Collective won it last year. The slow-burn nature of pop success \u2013 the year also belonged to Sabrina Carpenter and Charli xcx, both on their respective sixth albums \u2013 may have influenced the BBC to change the eligibility rules as the prize reaches its 23rd year, hence the presence of fairly well-known acts on the list. To qualify, artists can not have had more than two UK Top 10 albums or two UK Top 10 singles prior to 30 September 2024. Previously, artists who had been the lead act on a UK No 1 or No 2 album, or with more than two Top 10 singles to their name, were ineligible. But the Top 40 may not be the most accurate barometer of popularity in the age of streaming. Croydon rapper Pozer\u2019s debut single Kitchen Stove peaked at No 22 in March but has racked up more than 30m streams on Spotify. Irish rap trio Kneecap released their second album, Fine Art, this year, as well as an eponymous feature film that was selected as Ireland\u2019s entry for the international category at the Academy awards. Barry Can\u2019t Swim, AKA Scottish producer Joshua Mainnie, was also nominated for this year\u2019s Mercury prize, drew massive crowds at Glastonbury, and is due to headline one day of the London festival series All Points East in 2025. The US rapper Doechii won acclaim for her 2024 mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal and appears on the latest album by Tyler, the Creator. At the genuinely newer end of things sits British Jamaican songwriter Myles Smith, who released his debut single last year and whose ubiquitous, platinum-certified single Stargazing peaked at No 4. There are also UK pop-rock duo Good Neighbours, who released their debut single in January, and breakout US singer and guitarist Mk.gee, AKA Michael Todd Gordon, who has won plaudits from stars as disparate as Frank Ocean, Justin Bieber and Eric Clapton. The nominees were chosen by a panel of more than 180 representatives from the music industry, and musicians including Elton John, the Blessed Madonna and former Sound of \u2026 nominees Dua Lipa and Jorja Smith, and the 2014 winner, Sam Smith.",

        "trailText": "Billie Eilish and Charli XCX dominate 2024 countdown as Royel Otis\u2019s cover of Murder on the Dancefloor comes in second",
        "bodyText": "Chappell Roan has taken the number one spot in Australia\u2019s largest music poll, Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100, with her song Good Luck, Babe! The American singer-songwriter enjoyed a breakthrough year in 2024, when her debut album proved a sleeper hit in the year after its release \u2013 taking her from obscurity to global fame. Good Luck, Babe!, a follow-up single released after her album began climbing the charts, has since become Roan\u2019s biggest hit. Coming in at No 2 was Australia\u2019s Royel Otis, who took the runner-up spot with their cover of UK pop star Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s noughties hit Murder on the Dancefloor. Their indie-rock take on that sparkly pop classic, released as a Triple J Like A Version, went viral last year, amassing over 67m streams globally, and reaching No 1 on the US Alternative Airplay chart. The Sydney pop duo also had three original tracks feature in the poll. But beyond the top two, this year\u2019s countdown was dominated by two other international pop stars: Charli xcx and Billie Eilish. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Charli xcx, who painted 2024 neon green with her smash hit album Brat, had eight different tracks place in the countdown. Her highest ranking was Guess, a smutty collaboration featuring Eilish, which placed at No 6. The TikTok sensation Apple appeared at No 20 and the remixed version of Girl, So Confusing, featuring New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde, landed at No 26. Eilish, meanwhile, landed at No 3 with the lovestruck Birds of a Feather and had a further six solo songs place in the poll. But homegrown artists were noticeably few and far between in this year\u2019s countdown, with just 29 songs coming from Australian acts. That\u2019s a steep decline from previous years: in the 2023 Hottest 100, 52 of the songs came from Australian artists, while the 2022 Hottest 100 featured 57 tracks from local acts. Triple J executives have attributed the fall in part to a changing music industry, in which social media and streaming platforms are increasingly important for music discovery \u2013 but can also be tough to crack. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination [of factors] \u2013 it\u2019s obviously been a big year of releases from some key [international] artists, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish in particular,\u201d says Lachlan Macara, the head of Triple J. \u201cI also think you\u2019ve got Australian artists competing on a global scale [on social media and streaming] \u2026 what I hear from Australian artists is that it can be a real challenge to cut through the algorithm.\u201d Macara sees the results as \u201ca chance to have a wider conversation about how we can all support Australian music.\u201d Certainly, Australian music had a tough time on the charts in 2024. Just five out of 100 songs on Aria\u2019s year-end charts were Australian \u2013 and one of them was Vance Joy\u2019s Riptide, released more than ten years ago. Riptide is still the current No 1 track on the Aria Australian singles chart and was recently revealed as the most streamed Australian song by Australians on Spotify in 2024. And Triple J, perhaps once the most important platform for breaking new Australian music, has seen its own taste making influence wane. Listener numbers have steadily decreased in recent years. The station captured just 4.3% of broadcast audiences in 2023-2024, down from 4.6% the previous year and 5.5% the year before that \u2013 with the majority of listeners older than Triple J\u2019s core 18-24 demographic. The highest placing original Australian track was the electronic track Girl$ from producer Dom Dolla, at No. 7, while acts like R\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL and Amyl and the Sniffers both enjoyed multiple entries in the poll. A total of 2.4m votes were cast in the countdown, which was broadcast on Triple J on Saturday. This was the first Hottest 100 without former music director Richard Kingsmill, who departed the station after 35 years at the end of 2023 in a rumoured redundancy \u2013 part of a restructure that saw several other senior staff members also exit. This month, the station celebrated 50 years on air. Despite a disappointing result for homegrown acts in the Hottest 100, Macara says Triple J remains committed to platforming Australian artists. The station says it does play more than 50% Australian music every week \u2013 above its government-mandated quota of 40%, and much higher than the commercial radio quota of 25%. \u201cI think especially in our 50th year, we\u2019ve got some big things cooking to remind people about the unique cultural worth of Australian music,\u201d Macara says. \u2022 This story was amended on 28 January 2025 to reflect that three original Royel Otis tracks featured in the poll in addition to a cover by the band; an earlier version incorrectly stated two.",

        "trailText": "Kendrick Lamar celebrated his rap beef victory in a \u2018Canadian tuxedo\u2019, Chappell Roan called out the industry and Nashville finally backed Beyonc\u00e9",
        "bodyText": "Drake was humiliated It\u2019s the kind of stress dream that pop stars tell their therapists about: \u201cMy artistic rival won record and song of the year at the Grammys for a track attacking me, and everyone was dancing and singing along. Even Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d And so it came to pass for Drake, seeing Kendrick Lamar win for Not Like Us, walking to the podium in double denim \u2013 a \u201cCanadian tuxedo\u201d, no less \u2013 while half the arena seemed to chant \u201ctryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably a minor\u201d, a line alleging child sexual abuse (which Drake has strenuously denied). Drake has long framed the Grammys as somewhere that doesn\u2019t understand rap music and he had already distanced himself from the awards \u2013 and perhaps that turned Recording Academy voters against him all the more. But these were deserved wins for Lamar \u2013 the beef allowed him to turn his lens away from himself, and in so doing made a very 21st-century entertainment: gossipy, networked, and packed with reference. Meanwhile, having seen the entire industry united in celebration against him makes you wonder anew: where next for Drake? Chappell Roan called for workers\u2019 rights \u2026 For all her playfulness on stage and on record, there\u2019s also a seriousness of intent to Chappell Roan: part of the reason she\u2019s so loved is that she totally devotes herself to her craft, selling every line she sings. That\u2019s played out in her earnest politics, too, whether upbraiding a hectoring paparazzo, fretting about who to back (if anyone) in the US presidential race, and championing the rights of queer people and Palestinians. At the Grammys, she used the platform of a best new artist win to advocate for workers\u2019 rights, namely her fellow musicians, with a \u201cdemand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a livable wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\u201d She spoke of struggling to afford health insurance in her early career, saying: \u201cIt was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised to not have health[care]. If my label would have prioritised artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to \u2026 Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d \u2026 and Lady Gaga for trans rights As Donald Trump enshrines transphobia in American law, Lady Gaga spoke out, saying: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d She was speaking after winning best pop duo/group performance for Die With a Smile, with Bruno Mars. Doechii capped her breakthrough year \u2026 Twenty-six-year-old rapper Doechii beat some of the most venerable, successful and respected MCs in the US \u2013 Eminem, Future, J Cole and the paired-up Common and Pete Rock \u2013 to win best rap album, only the third woman to win this category after Lauryn Hill and Cardi B. This caps a stunning breakthrough over the past year, with jaws floored by the emphatically enunciated, elastically rhythmic raps on her album Alligator Bites Don\u2019t Heal, and then again by performances such as on Stephen Colbert\u2019s talkshow, her braided hair fused to that of her dancers. Her performance on the Grammys\u2019 stage was even stronger, a brilliantly choreographed strut through Denial Is a River where \u2013 with some expert help from her DJ, Miss Milan \u2013 she kept her flow going through high kicks, trust falls and a suit-busting bikini reveal. \u2026 as did Sierra Ferrell With her fourth album, Ferrell made a clean sweep of the roots and Americana categories, winning all four of the awards she was nominated for (in a less brutally competitive year, she would have got a best new artist nomination too). Dressed in one of the night\u2019s wackier outfits \u2013 think East End pearly queen after five rounds of AI enhancement, complete with sceptre \u2013 she\u2019s travelled a long way from the trailer-dwelling and freight train-hopping of her youth, to become a multimillion-streaming performer. As country and pop do-si-do ever more tightly, Ferrell, Zach Bryan and more are winning millions of fans drawn to a more authentic and analogue-sounding version of this vintage American music. Beyonc\u00e9 finally won album of the year She may have been the most-awarded star in history, but given the industry places such stock in the album format, Beyonc\u00e9 not winning that category felt like a big snub \u2013 particularly given her self-titled album lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase (not remotely the best album that year or in his own catalogue), while her great masterpiece 4 wasn\u2019t even nominated. So that wrong has now been righted. Some may be dismayed that it took a country album to do it, rather than an R&amp;B, pop or dance record \u2013 and Cowboy Carter has plenty of longueurs and even outright missteps. But it also contains some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most imaginative and beautiful music \u2013 the way Riverdance flows into II Hands II Heaven makes it the loveliest brace of songs on an album in her catalogue. Its bigger win in some ways is best country album, showing that Beyonc\u00e9 has convinced not just the broad pool of voters in the general field categories, but also the Nashville establishment who vote for the country awards. An American won best global music album Matt B, a little-streamed musician born and raised in Illinois and based in the US, beat representatives from Spain (Antonio Rey), Peru (Ciro Hurtado), and Nigeria (superstars Tems and Rema) to win best global music album for Alkebulan II, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. His album certainly creates a global dialogue, as he explores his African heritage with multilingual lyrics, lilting Afro-pop, and guests such as South African poet Nomfundo Khambule. But as the US enters its protectionist era under Trump, there may be some disquiet at this win. A multimillionare businesswoman won best new age album It\u2019s a shame that the great Ryuichi Sakamoto, the Japanese musician who died of cancer aged 71 in 2023 having changed the face of his country\u2019s popular music, wasn\u2019t honoured in the category for best new age, ambient or chant album. His nominated LP Opus was full of his very particular piano style, full of chords that feel cautious and yet intentional, and where sentimentality is offset by chalky, dissonant notes. Instead, he lost to the little-heard Triveni by Wouter Kellerman, Eru Matsumoto and Chandrika Tandon, the latter a businesswoman and philanthropist (and sister of former Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi) who worked for McKinsey before starting her own financial services firm. The Academy still loves Chris Stapleton He lost to Beyonc\u00e9 in the country album category, but Stapleton notched up his fifth win in 10 years in the best country solo performance category, a mark of how much the country-voting portion of the Recording Academy adores this artist, who pleases both staunch traditionalists while being relatively progressive \u2013 that\u2019s 11 wins overall for him now. It\u2019s a shame, though, that he won with a low-stakes ballad from the same album as his win last year, while shutting out Shaboozey\u2019s pop culturally dominant A Bar Song (Tipsy) in the process. Chris Brown was awarded Way after his notorious assault on Rihanna, Chris Brown has been accused of a long list of crimes against numerous women over the years, which he has denied \u2013 last week he sued over how he was represented in a new documentary, with lawyers saying: \u201cMr Brown has never been found guilty of any sex related crime \u2026 but this documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.\u201d His win for best R&amp;B album, over a big breakthrough by Muni Long and another veteran in Usher, plus others, shows that he still has his backers in the Recording Academy. But there has been disquiet online \u2013 just as there has for Kanye West\u2019s red carpet appearance with his wife, Bianca Censori essentially appearing nude, the latest in a series of mute, near-undressed appearances alongside him that have provoked widespread concern for her welfare. Female artists did well \u2013 but men still dominate behind the scenes Two of the \u201cbig four\u201d were won by female artists, but when you look into the actual winners, they were overwhelmingly male. These awards are shared by the producers, songwriters, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers and while there is some heartening female representation \u2013 such as Idania Valencia who mastered Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, and songwriters such as Elizabeth Lowell Boland and songwriter of the year winner Amy Allen \u2013 analysis by Akas found that only 9% of winners in the top four categories were women. And it was a bad night for the Brits Charli xcx was the chief British representative, and she gave an instantly viral bum-wiggling, underwear-chucking live performance of Guess on the night, but she was shut out of the big prizes, making do with dance-pop awards. And it wasn\u2019t a great night for other Brits. Belfast\u2019s Jordan Adetunji was beaten to the melodic rap prize by Rapsody and Erykah Badu, Raye lost out twice, while Jacob Collier\u2019s seventh win was a minor award, for arrangement. Instead we had to rely on the Beatles and the Rolling Stones for some face-saving wins, for best rock performance and album respectively (while Sean Ono Lennon also picked up an award, for co-creating the box set release of his father\u2019s album Mind Games). \u2022 This article was updated on 3 February with a correction: Beyonce\u2019s self-titled album, not Lemonade, lost to Beck\u2019s Morning Phase.",

        "bodyText": "Record of the year The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 360 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Since the Grammys expanded their top category to eight (and briefly 10) nominations, there\u2019s tended to be a bit of filler \u2013 but not so this year, where little separates this impossible-to-call field of Recording Academy darlings. Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many \u2013 and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour \u2013 but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyonc\u00e9 has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold \u2019Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters \u2013 who value craft and chops \u2013 admiring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s capacity for making country music her own. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Kendrick Lamar Album of the year Andr\u00e9 3000 \u2013 New Blue Sun Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Cowboy Carter Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Short N\u2019 Sweet Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Jacob Collier \u2013 Djesse Vol 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Hit Me Hard and Soft Chappell Roan \u2013 The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess Taylor Swift \u2013 The Tortured Poets Department For the same reason, I think Beyonc\u00e9 will triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years \u2013 a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: \u201cAOTY, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2019bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,\u201d as Beyonc\u00e9 sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin\u2019. Cowboy Carter isn\u2019t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon \u2013 and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here \u2013 but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent. Will win Beyonc\u00e9 Should win Charli xcx Song of the year Shaboozey \u2013 A Bar Song (Tipsy) Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga \u2013 Die With a Smile Taylor Swift \u2013 Fortnight (ft Post Malone) Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Please Please Please Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Enter two big beasts in Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history \u2013 and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar\u2019s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile\u2019s lyrics are really hackneyed (\u201cour love\u2019s the only war worth fighting for\u201d), particularly when compared with Roan\u2019s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter\u2019s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we\u2019re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us \u2013 the only song here with a single songwriter \u2013 is the diss track by which all others will now be judged. Will win Kendrick Lamar Should win Kendrick Lamar Best new artist Benson Boone Sabrina Carpenter Doechii Khruangbin Raye Chappell Roan Shaboozey Teddy Swims Higher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It\u2019s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan\u2019s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there\u2019s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there\u2019s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves \u2013 puckish, vital, anti-mumbling \u2013 whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Chappell Roan Best pop solo performance Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Bodyguard Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Charli xcx \u2013 Apple Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Given Brat\u2019s success and Apple\u2019s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering, spit-slurping manner, but this is formidable company. Here\u2019s another category that Beyonc\u00e9 has never won, though Bodyguard doesn\u2019t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish\u2019s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here\u2019s hoping one of pop\u2019s class of 2024 can net it: Roan\u2019s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song\u2019s groove. Will win Chappell Roan Should win Sabrina Carpenter Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then The Black Keys \u2013 Beautiful People (Stay High) Green Day \u2013 The American Dream Is Killing Me Idles \u2013 Gift Horse Pearl Jam \u2013 Dark Matter St Vincent \u2013 Broken Man The Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant \u2013 and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from the Black Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best \u2013 and the most purely rocking \u2013 is Pearl Jam\u2019s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll to its opening riff. Will win The Beatles Should win Pearl Jam Best rap performance Cardi B \u2013 Enough (Miami) Common and Pete Rock \u2013 When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos) Doechii \u2013 Nissan Altima Eminem \u2013 Houdini Future and Metro Boomin \u2013 Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar) GloRilla \u2013 Yeah Glo! Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Lamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That \u2013 the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio \u2013 increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem\u2019s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There\u2019s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery \u2013 much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter\u2019s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival\u2019s anatomy as \u201cregular-degular\u201d will have you spitting out your drink).

Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year\u2019s winner White Horse \u2013 and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves\u2019 song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll\u2019s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyonc\u00e9 winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on \u2013 but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song. Will win Shaboozey Should win Shaboozey",

        "trailText": "It was heartening \u2013 if expected \u2013 to see Beyonc\u00e9, Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx and Chappell Roan all grab gongs, while an award for the Beatles suggests confidence in AI",
        "bodyText": "Like all major awards ceremonies, the Grammys spawn a mini-industry in predictions: in the weeks before the winners are announced, a rash of articles inevitably appear in which expert voices scan the nominations and foretell who\u2019s going to win. This year, you didn\u2019t really need in-depth knowledge of the music industry or the Recording Academy\u2019s internal machinations to work out what was going to happen, unless there was a major upset. Across the previous 12 months, a succession of artists impacted in a way that pop music is no longer supposed to do. Its once-central defining role within broader popular culture is held to have been vastly diminished by social media, and yet Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us wasn\u2019t just a huge commercial success, it influenced everything, from US sports to the campaign messaging of the American presidential election to sales of the fashion brands featured in its video: if you were going to dub anything the song of the year, it was obviously going to be that. Likewise, Charli xcx\u2019s Brat, an album which caught a mood so completely, its title wound up a widely used (if nebulously defined) adjective: the notion of it ending the night unrewarded seemed fairly unthinkable (though it didn\u2019t triumph in its biggest nominated categories). Moreover, Brat was part of a noticeable shift in the tone of mainstream pop music, away from impeccably styled, media-trained, Instagram-filtered perfection towards something messier, more heartfelt and personal, a state of affairs it would have been faintly nuts for the Academy not to recognise. This wasn\u2019t merely the kind of trend that provokes think pieces from critics and ups the general quality of pop music \u2013 it was one that also sold millions of records by Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, both of whom deservedly did well on the night. Should anyone doubt that a new mood in pop is abroad, it\u2019s worth noting that Roan turned up to the ceremony wearing a wimple and drag-queen makeup and spent her acceptance speech excoriating the music industry for its unwillingness to provide young artists with a living wage in an era of record profits. You probably wouldn\u2019t have expected that from the best new artist winner a few years back, but it\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that Chappell Roan does: she\u2019s both impressively outspoken and possessed of a very original take on how a pop star should look. Elsewhere, you could certainly argue the Beyonc\u00e9 albums that failed to snare the album of the year category in previous years were qualitatively better than the album that finally won it \u2013 certainly, 2016\u2019s Lemonade and 2022\u2019s Renaissance were more consistent and conceptually more coherent \u2013 but you\u2019d be harder pushed to make a case that Cowboy Carter wasn\u2019t impactful enough. For all it seemed to tire of its Beyonc\u00e9-goes-country theme midway through, throwing in everything from hip-hop to psychedelic soul, Cowboy Carter felt of the moment. It featured Shaboozey \u2013 ahead of his single A Bar Song (Tipsy) spending a record-setting 19 weeks at the top of the US chart \u2013 and it was part of the ongoing vogue for pop artists shifting their sound towards something more country-adjacent, unencumbered by the kind of this-isn\u2019t-country dismissal from Nashville that famously dogged Lil Nas X\u2019s similarly successful Old Town Road five years ago. Indeed, the closest the Grammys came to controversy \u2013 aside from awards for Chris Brown and Dave Chappelle, and a provocative appearance by Kanye West and his wife \u2013 was when it seemed most traditional, handing out the best rock performance gong to the Beatles for Now and Then. You could view that as merely an act of sentiment \u2013 Now and Then was, after all, dubbed \u201cthe last Beatles single\u201d, a final leave-taking from the biggest band of all time \u2013 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that it was a rock performance that required AI to make it happen, previous attempts at extracting a usable vocal from John Lennon\u2019s unfinished 1977 demo having failed because the equipment wasn\u2019t up to it. The rights and wrongs of using AI in music have been hotly debated and one way you could read Now and Then\u2019s success is as a tacit thumbs-up from the music business for a deeply divisive technology, or at least a hopeful suggestion that it might be a wonderful tool rather than a catastrophe for creativity. You have to admire their optimism.",

        "trailText": "Whether making rabbits for Chappell Roan or dangling Pink upside down, these professionals build entire worlds for pop\u2019s A-listers. They explain their singular craft",
        "bodyText": "Pop star Chappell Roan has said she doesn\u2019t care about chart performance, radio play or awards, but in the lead-up to the 2025 Grammys, she appealed to witches, wiccans and others with higher power to secure just one nomination for her: best recording package, awarded for album artwork. \u201cIt\u2019s not televised, most people don\u2019t know about it, but \u2026 this means a lot to me,\u201d she said. Pleading alongside her was Ramisha Sattar, Roan\u2019s creative director. The design they submitted for Grammys consideration was a set of paper dolls Sattar conceptualised for the first-anniversary edition vinyl of The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, which can be slotted into the LP\u2019s cardboard sleeve, cut to resemble parted stage curtains. \u201cIt feels like a little craft day when you\u2019re putting them together \u2013 and that\u2019s what so much of the album behind the scenes looks like for us,\u201d says Sattar now, speaking on a video call. Sattar works with Roan not only on her album packaging but also her merchandise, marketing, stage concepts and more. Creative directors like her are becoming increasingly vital as pop stars manage the demands to produce social media content, products, blockbuster stadium tours and visually distinct \u201ceras\u201d of music. Kanye West may have established the blueprint with his collaboration with the late Virgil Abloh, while Ciarra Pardo worked with Rihanna for nearly a decade before becoming chief creative officer of the singer\u2019s company Fenty Corp. Oliver El-Khatib grew rapper Drake into a brand, October\u2019s Very Own, now synonymous with Toronto. Todd Tourso, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s long-time creative director, was instrumental in the career pivot of her 2014 \u201cvisual album\u201d, making her videos just as hotly anticipated as her music. More recently, Imogene Strauss \u2013 who has partnered with Caroline Polachek, Solange and Clairo \u2013 worked with Charli xcx on Brat, collaborating on the now-iconic shade of green for the cover and stoking the online memes that helped to turn the album into a cultural moment. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s creative director and stylist is her elder sister, Pili Vila. \u201cThey always come to the conversation with a very strong idea of what the song is about,\u201d says Nicol\u00e1s M\u00e9ndez, founder of the production company Canada, who has directed several of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s videos. Pienso en tu Mir\u00e1, a song about toxic love, inspired a concept about vampires with Spanish imagery drawn from the sisters\u2019 childhoods; TKN, about family, led to an idea for an unruly \u201cherd of kids\u201d with Rosal\u00eda as matriarch. \u201cOnce I have the concept, then it is just a matter of thinking around it, in every direction, and seeing what images come out,\u201d says M\u00e9ndez. Sattar, meanwhile, is \u201cjust as much Chappell Roan as I am\u201d, Roan has said. They started working together in 2022, after Roan came across Sattar\u2019s work and sent her a message on Instagram. Sattar designed some merchandise, then worked as a wardrobe assistant for the videos for Casual and My Kink Is Karma before joining Roan\u2019s team. Now she works closely with stylist Genesis Webb and set designer Maris Jones across all of Chappell Roan\u2019s varied output, \u201cmaking sure that there\u2019s that through line \u2026 that makes it all feel like Chappell\u201d. The briefs can be varied, including sourcing items for shoots and matching colours and fabrics to individual songs, but what makes a design or concept \u201cChappell Roan\u201d \u2013 as opposed to Sabrina Carpenter, say, or Olivia Rodrigo \u2013 \u201ccan\u2019t really be condensed down to a one-pager,\u201d says Sattar. \u201cSometimes we know exactly what we want, and sometimes the fun part is figuring it out.\u201d The first step is often a mood board. \u201cWe have a lot of fun during that moment: \u2018Let\u2019s reference this vintage thing we found at a flea, and also our favourite movie\u2019,\u201d says Sattar. The starting point for the charming lyric video for Good Luck, Babe! \u2013 which spent 14 weeks in the UK Top 5 \u2013 was imagining a teenager\u2019s enthusiasm for Microsoft PowerPoint. \u201cYou\u2019d add in these unnecessary transitions, and the colours almost hurt your eyes because you used every single one \u2013 that was kind of the vibe,\u201d Sattar says. \u201cLike, if someone made this on their laptop.\u201d At other times, the direction is suggested by lyrics. The video for Hot to Go! was inspired by its cheerleader-chant chorus and playful allusions to takeout food. The lyric \u201churry up, it\u2019s getting cold\u201d invoked red and white, says Sattar. \u201cWe referenced a lot of old napkins, pizza boxes \u2026 [and] played into the diner aesthetic.\u201d One early item of merch, a bandana showing a wand-wielding rabbit, was similarly inspired by a fan-favourite lyric from Red Wine Supernova. \u201cIt\u2019s about making stuff that you know people are going to be excited about,\u201d Sattar says. \u201cThey pick up on every little detail.\u201d Baz Halpin, chief executive and founder of production agency Silent House, agrees that a strong visual concept can help to foster loyalty and community among fans. When he began his career in the mid-90s, lighting was musicians\u2019 chief means of making a statement on stage, \u201cand video was really the realm of the very successful, wealthy performers\u201d, he says. Today, \u201caudiences are much more sophisticated\u201d, with an inexhaustible demand for content. Where details about stadium shows used to be tightly restricted, behind-the-scenes material and even setlists are now shared ahead of time, \u201cjust to feed that media machine\u201d, Halpin says. The process always starts with a conversation about what the artist is wanting to say. \u201cIt can be more than a concert \u2013 it can have a message, a narrative,\u201d Halpin says, pointing to set designer Willie Williams\u2019 work with U2, from the 1992 Zoo TV tour to 2023\u2019s Achtung Baby Live at Sphere. \u201cAny artist that is known for having a great visual presentation over multiple tours, will always have a director that they have worked with for decades.\u201d Halpin namechecks Justin Timberlake as one performer who \u201cloves the practical side\u201d of putting together a stadium spectacle \u2013 but \u201cmost do not operate on that technical level, or want to\u201d. Halpin\u2019s longest-running relationship is 20 years with Pink, who was inspired by seeing aerialists at a Cher concert to apply her own background in gymnastics to her shows. Over successive tours, Halpin has helped to develop the performance from a simple silks routine to the high-level aerial acrobatics that now define a Pink show. The moments of a performance that resonate, however, can be unexpected. \u201cLeft Shark\u201d, the much-memed backing dancer from Katy Perry\u2019s Super Bowl spectacle, was \u201cone of those happy accidents\u201d, Halpin says. \u201cIf anything, I thought the singing palm trees would get more play.\u201d But it all worked perfectly with Perry\u2019s fun-filled style of the time: \u201cAudiences can smell fakeness a miles away \u2013 it\u2019s important that you\u2019re always being true to who the artist is.\u201d The creative director\u2019s job is to help them to convey that, Halpin adds. He may not be known by fans of Swift, Pink or Perry \u2013 just as Chappell Roan fans may not know Sattar. But she has still profoundly shaped the career of pop\u2019s newest superstar, as recognised, albeit indirectly, by the Grammys. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the packaging nomination \u2013 but we got six other ones,\u201d she says triumphantly.",

        "bodyText": "20 MJ Lenderman \u2013 Wristwatch The year\u2019s breakout indie star, Jake Lenderman has a voice like the last roll of the die. On his fourth album, Manning Fireworks, he uses it to portray a series of sad-sack men reaching for Eric Clapton records and cool gadgets to assert their virility, filled with the weary, palpably desperate sense that maybe, just maybe, their day has finally come. It\u2019s the type of figure that in comedian Tim Robinson\u2019s hands would be an absurdist nightmare (he will honk if he\u2019s horny), but in Lenderman\u2019s, they reek with a very specific kind of pathos: the protagonist of Wristwatch has a techy new timepiece that\u2019s a compass, a cell phone, a pocketknife and a megaphone \u2026 that also \u201ctells me I\u2019m on my own\u201d. The hangdog tumble of electric guitar and pedal steel \u2013 like a more earth-bound Magnolia Electric Co \u2013 shifts between sounding crushed and bright, neither tragedy nor hope ever quite winning out. But Lenderman\u2019s unique voice prevails: who else this year would have come up with the line: \u201cI got a houseboat docked at the Himbo Dome\u201d? Laura Snapes 19 Clairo \u2013 Sexy to Someone Clairo\u2019s album Charm was that word made manifest, and Sexy to Someone was perhaps the most charming moment of all. Made with Dap-Kings and Lee Fields collaborator Leon Michel, gently insistent vintage soul is the backdrop for a robustly funny and wry song about putting hotness at the top of one\u2019s hierarchy of needs: \u201cSexy to somebody, it would help me out / Oh, I need a reason to get out of the house.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas 18 Lady Gaga \u2013 Disease After the flop of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and her accompanying album of big band standards, Gaga swept the embarrassment away as if with a swish of a meat dress, in this triumphant return to her core electro-pop sound. The malevolent beat could have been made by Gesaffelstein or Justice (actually it involves Cirkut, who had a big hand in Charli xcx\u2019s Brat); lurching forward like a horny Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the track is perfect for Gaga\u2019s histrionically camp series of psychosexual illness metaphors. BBT 17 Yaeji \u2013 Booboo The Korean-American producer broke through in 2017 with Raingurl, an underground club smash animated by her skipping-chant vocals. She then went on to massively expand her sound into progressive electronic pop, but returned to her roots with Booboo. With a satisfyingly stripped-back Jersey club beat, it\u2019s a song both for and about the club, where she is \u201cheadbanging all night \u2026 find me at the front right\u201d. But it\u2019s not all abandon \u2013 she interpolates Raingurl as she considers the growing pains between her two dance hits. BBT 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2019Em Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Post Malone and Morgan Wallen\u2019s I Had Some Help may have cantered past it to become the pop-country crossovers of the year, but Beyonc\u00e9 was first out the gate, with Texas Hold \u2019Em becoming her first UK No 1 since 2008. With banjos and a muffled beat like a cowboy boot stomping on a dusty floor, it\u2019s authentically rootsy, and for all her star wattage there\u2019s something almost homely about her relaxed, conversational singing style. BBT 15 Kassie Krut \u2013 Reckless There are few cooler moves than launching with a manifesto song, and even if you didn\u2019t know Eve Alpert and Kasra Kurt from their former band, Philly math-rockers Palm (now joined by their producer Matt Anderegg), they make a compelling pitch to get with the picture fast. Alpert\u2019s chanted vocals about being fast, free, best and mean hit somewhere between Coco &amp; Clair Clair and Charli xcx; the brute drum beat, industrial shudder and off-kilter pop sensibility vaults back to Peaches and early Micachu and the Shapes. It\u2019s the hypnotic nonchalance of Alpert\u2019s vocals amid the discordance that makes Reckless so seductive: she sounds untouchable, but that won\u2019t stop you from trying to get close. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she sings. \u201cThere\u2019s a runner in me.\u201d LS 14 Ariana Grande \u2013 We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love) This was easily the biggest hit from Grande\u2019s album Eternal Sunshine, and while it didn\u2019t have the compositional originality elsewhere \u2013 such as The Boy Is Mine with its exquisite time-stretched chorus \u2013 it makes up for that with intense melancholy. Clearly indebted to Robyn\u2019s electro-pop heartbreak anthems but given a softer sheen, Grande said she wanted \u201cpeople to make of it what they will\u201d. It could be about an almost-romance, but the more interesting reading is that it\u2019s about Grande\u2019s relationship with the media and public perception: \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna feed this monstrous fire / Just wanna let this story die \u2026 Me and my truth, we sit in silence.\u201d BBT 13 Waxahatchee \u2013 Right Back to It (ft MJ Lenderman) Right Back to It may be the most perfect portrait of what it is to be the stubborn half of a relationship, the one prone to self-sabotage by second-guessing and refusing help. Katie Crutchfield sings that she\u2019s \u201cblunter than a bullseye\u201d, always \u201cbracing for a bombshell\u201d that never comes, while her partner has their \u201clove written on a blank check\u201d and bears the ease of \u201ca song with no end\u201d. It\u2019s partially a lament about the parts of one\u2019s nature you wish you could overcome, though really it plays more like a love letter to difference, and to the kind of partner who gives you the space to learn how to go easy on yourself (you can imagine this soundtracking many first dances). Crutchfield has that ease licked in one respect, anyway: the song\u2019s intermittently interlocking guitar and banjo, coupled with her conversational phrasing, are a total balm. LS 12 Kim Gordon \u2013 Bye Bye Bye Bye is essentially a very high-end packing list incanted with Kim Gordon\u2019s typically alluring hauteur: designer clothes, homeopathic remedies, \u201cpyjamas \u2013 silk\u201d. But the muscular industrial roil and sharp, stabbing squeaks underpinning her suitcase inventory imply that she\u2019s less bound for a luxury resort than some sort of bunk or heist, evoking the heroines of Play It as It Lays, Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Any More, Thelma and Louise or, more darkly, A Woman Under the Influence. Wherever she\u2019s going, take it as read that you can\u2019t come. LS 11 The Cure \u2013 Alone The lead single from the album Songs of a Lost World was the Cure\u2019s first new music in 16 years, and it made an appropriately grand and stately entrance. Unlike pop songs that tease the chorus in the opening seconds so you don\u2019t press skip, Robert Smith\u2019s vocals don\u2019t even come in for three and a half minutes as the band generate a symphonic, slowly stuttering groove. Smith then raises a toast to endings: of art, of nature, of idealism, of the children we used to be. This song acknowledges that our world is dying, or at least our version of it \u2013 and yet its determined beauty reminds us that we can still make something meaningful. BBT 10 Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Forget Gladiator II \u2013 the entertainment industry\u2019s greatest man-to-man combat of the year came between Kendrick Lamar and Drake in their remarkably heated multi-track beef this spring. The kill shot was Not Like Us \u2013 not only did it have a DJ Mustard beat that made it the rare diss track you could dance to, Lamar\u2019s framing of Drake as a cultural leech had real credence, while the allegations of involvement with young girls were what everyone wanted to believe: \u201cTryna strike a chord and it\u2019s probably A minor\u201d became the most quotable line in the whole debacle. Drake denied the allegations: \u201cOnly fuckin\u2019 with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns / I\u2019d never look twice at no teenager\u201d was actually an impressively reference-packed retort, but by then he\u2019d been backed into a corner and Lamar didn\u2019t have to bother with a reply. BBT 9 Nick Le\u00f3n and Erika de Casier \u2013 Bikini After a couple of edits and co-productions, the Miami DJ and Portuguese-Danish producer finally teamed up proper with a beachy-minded track debuted, fittingly, at Primavera festival in Barcelona. This trancey dembow thumper intensifies in tandem with the single-minded crush de Casier outlines in a distant voice, one that suggests a gaze fixed on the limits of the horizon, waiting for her paramour to appear. The chorus \u2013 \u201cMeet me at the beach / It\u2019s me in the bikini\u201d \u2013 is an earworm; the balance of sad and sexy almost comically on point. LS 8 Addison Rae \u2013 Diet Pepsi It\u2019s been a tricky year for the American fast food industry. Such simple pleasures as caffeinated drinks and cheese-larded pizzas have been turned into wanton metaphors for activities of a sexual nature by some of the nation\u2019s most brazen young pop stars. Chappell Roan wants to \u201cget it hot like Papa John\u201d. Sabrina Carpenter intends to \u201cMountain Dew it for ya\u201d. And while one-time TikTok dancer Addison Rae actually claims that she wants to refresh herself with some Diet Pepsi \u2013 which has barely recovered from the besmirching Lana Del Rey gave it 12 years ago \u2013 she stipulates that she\u2019ll be \u201csitting on his lap\u201d as she does so. Coupled with an extremely breathy, addictively trappy slow jam that evokes Lana gasping for oxygen, you rather get the impression that this great American refreshment might actually be some sort of horny hors d\u2019oeuvre. Deary me! Great key change though. LS 7 Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Like I Say (I Runaway) It\u2019s hard to pick a standout song from Nil\u00fcfer Yanya\u2019s third album, My Method Actor, the whole thing is such a heated, fractious mood. But Like I Say (I Runaway) is a great example of what an idiosyncratic songwriter the always-brilliant Yanya has become. The third song on this list about making a break for it (alongside Kassie Krut and Kim Gordon), it takes an elusive approach to the subject: the cool verses mingling the spectre of trip-hop and Radiohead\u2019s heavy-thumbed acoustics as Yanya outlines her self-protective MO. The writhing, staticky wallop of the chorus crashes down with the weight of the feelings and uncertainty she\u2019s running from, powering a captivatingly desperate vocal performance. LS 6 Fontaines DC \u2013 Starburster / Favourite Korn were the unlikely touchstone for Starburster, the return single by Ireland\u2019s finest, and they nailed both sides of the rap-rock equation. The drums hit like a boom-bap beat, and Grian Chatten has the relentless flow of a battle-hardened MC, spitting surrealist brags (\u201cI got a shadow like a .58 calibre / I wanna move like a new salamander\u201d) and inhaling hard in a song inspired by a panic attack. The rest of the band give him the space he needs, providing spaghetti western twangs and a strange, dreamy middle-eight that\u2019s like the sudden return of clarity \u2013 only for chaos to crash back in. Plenty of our writers also voted for Favourite, their 80s-indie anthem whose warmth and poignancy felt heroic after the nervy Starburster. BBT 5 Billie Eilish \u2013 Birds of a Feather / Lunch There was the faint sense that Eilish\u2019s star might be waning after her fame-jaded second album Happier Than Ever, but that was entirely extinguished by the success of follow-up Hit Me Hard and Soft, with Birds of a Feather becoming a massive global hit. Eilish makes bald declarations of love over a tender beat as soft as snow \u2013 but this romance is fraught, as her lover wavers and Eilish\u2019s patience snaps: \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit / Tell me it\u2019s a bit / Say you don\u2019t see it, your mind\u2019s polluted / Say you wanna quit, don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d There were also lots of votes for Lunch, her spry, ska-tinged ode to a very particular kind of nutrition, which put an adult spin on the troublemaking sound she broke out with. BBT 4 Jade \u2013 Angel of My Dreams Girls Aloud production geniuses Xenomania only worked with the girl band\u2019s successors Little Mix once, but their wild Frankensteinian style (often creating songs from the remnants of various other tracks) feels like the mutant blood pumping through former Mixer Jade Thirlwall\u2019s debut solo single. The lurch from massive Mariah chorus to snarling bloghouse verses and another, helium-voiced sped-up chorus feels as far from focus-grouped pop as humanly possible; closer to a head-spinning night out with your most captivatingly chaotic friend in all its ecstasy and freefall. LS 3 Charli xcx \u2013 The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde / Von Dutch / Guess (ft Billie Eilish) / 360 360 is about right: the vast array of Brat \u2013 and remixed Brat and It\u2019s Completely Different But Also Still Brat \u2013 tracks that our writers voted for reflected Charli xcx\u2019s wild range in a year that was often oversimplified to a single shade of acid green. \u201cI set the tone, it\u2019s my design\u201d she taunted, presciently, on our lowest-charting song, 360; the Guess redux with Billie was raunchy; Von Dutch unapologetically bitchy. But our top Brat song, The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, spanned its own entire world of emotional terrain, turning Charli\u2019s original song about her fears of a frenemy\u2019s intentions into a crazily moving moment of resolution between two singers who not only have the same hair, it turns out, but a whole lot of self-doubt and mutual admiration in common. She\u2019s your favourite reference, baby \u2013 but no one did it like her this year. LS 2 Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso From Tinashe\u2019s \u201ccan somebody match my freak\u201d to Charli\u2019s \u201cbumpin\u2019 that\u201d, smart lyricists now have one eye on the potential memes \u2013 and no one did it better than Sabrina Carpenter, whose ridiculously quotable chorus line \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d enraged syntax purists and enchanted everyone else. In fact, the lyrics throughout are a delight \u2013 \u201cwalked in and dream-came-trued it for ya\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t relate to desperation / My give-a-fucks are on vacation\u201d \u2013 though their airy confidence needed a singer to match. They had one in Carpenter, who oh-so-casually strutted through the song like someone who is so used to turning heads that they\u2019ve stopped even noticing. And following wave after wave of often stiff disco revivalism, the languorous funk licks made it really swing. It ends up being less caffeine hit, more cocktail buzz. BBT 1 Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck, Babe! Once you hear it you can\u2019t unhear it: the opening synths of Good Luck, Babe! sound a bit like Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas \u2013 and like George Michael, Chappell Roan understands intimately that denying your true self is a fool\u2019s errand. Before she was Chappell Roan, she was Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, a closeted sad-girl singer-songwriter who ultimately got dropped just as she was coming into her sound. The song that led her there was Pink Pony Club, a sleeper hit that wedded a truly Freddie-worthy \u201cmama!\u201d to a yarn about finding herself \u2013 ie the Roan persona \u2013 at a Hollywood queer club. It became the first of many deeply camp, nothing-left-to-lose tracks Roan and producer Daniel Nigro made for her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released last September. That was another sleeper hit, its fuse properly lit this spring by increasingly viral footage of Roan\u2019s riotous live shows and this new, non-album single about a futile affair with a girl who protests that she\u2019s straight. There are other clear influences in Good Luck, Babe! Roan has the rough-hewn vocal ribaldry of Cyndi Lauper, the stentorian command of Hounds of Love-era Kate Bush, the high-goth drama of Shakespears Sister, a cabaret swoon so perfect you can picture the fake tear glued to the corner of her eye \u2013 but it\u2019s also entirely her own creation, a towering layer cake of frustration, festivity and fury that rewards a million repeat plays. In the verse, she\u2019s the despondent fool letting herself be played, but by the chorus, she\u2019s warning her intended that, try as she might, she\u2019ll never manage to Sisyphus desire, backed by a full, heavenly choir that suggests the angels are absolutely on Roan\u2019s side. Her sheer existence \u2013 and total domination of pop this year \u2013 are proof that she knows exactly what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYou know I hate to say, but: I told you so!\u201d she roars in the middle eight. I don\u2019t think she hates to say it at all. LS",

        "headline": "Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100: pop reigns, but how will Australian music fare?",
        "trailText": "Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish are predicted to dominate Australia\u2019s biggest music poll come Saturday\u2019s countdown, with only two local acts tipped for top-10 spots \u2013 and just one original Australian song",
        "bodyText": "When it airs on Saturday, the 32nd Triple J Hottest 100 countdown will cap off a whirlwind year for the youth radio station. There have been soaring highs: just last weekend, the station marked its mammoth five decades on air with a celebration attended by former and current presenters \u2013 as well as Anthony Albanese, who lauded the \u201cextraordinary achievement\u201d. But over the past 12 months, Triple J has continued to wrestle with its greatest existential crisis: how to engage young audiences as listenership declines steadily. The station captured just 4.3% of broadcast audiences in 2023-2024, down from 4.6% the previous year and 5.5% before that \u2013 with the majority of listeners older than Triple J\u2019s core 18-24 demographic. \u201cUnder 25s all around the world are used to consuming entertainment on demand, curated for them by algorithms which ensure they only see and hear stuff they probably already like,\u201d said one record label manager who asked not to be named. In the last year, the station has also generated controversy with several high-profile departures. This will be the first Hottest 100 without the influence of Richard Kingsmill: the kingmaker and longest-serving Triple J presenter, who left the ABC in late 2023 in a rumoured redundancy after 35 years at the station. Several other senior staff also exited at a similar time as part of a restructure of Triple J intended to \u201cevolve\u201d its offerings. It may no longer be the anti-establishment bacchanalia of its earliest days, or the alternative tastemaker of its peak in the 2000s and 2010s. But the station\u2019s countdown still draws gargantuan voting numbers \u2013 over 2.3m last year \u2013 and sends group chats ablaze with predictions and arguments. So how is this year\u2019s Hottest 100 shaping up? Viral sensations Triple J\u2019s target audience may no longer be tuning into the wireless \u2013 but they are lapping up its online content: the station has increased its following on all social channels in the past year. One song in particular went gangbusters when it was posted last January: Royel Otis\u2019s Like a Version cover of Murder on the Dancefloor, which transposed Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s original into a sunny blast of indie rock that now has 7.5m views on Triple J\u2019s YouTube and 3.9m on the station\u2019s TikTok \u2013 plus an additional 14m TikTok views when the Australian band posted it to their own account. If Royel Otis\u2019s cover wins, it will be the second Like a Version to take out the countdown after The Wiggles\u2019 2021 rendition of Elephant by Tame Impala. It\u2019s more likely, though, that this year\u2019s top spot will go to another utterly inescapable earworm: Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck, Babe!, a deeply camp poison-pen letter to a former lover complete with coruscating synths and a soaring, karaoke-hostile chorus sung entirely in falsetto. Countdown prediction site 100 Warm Tunas currently has Roan tipped to win, with Royel Otis coming in behind. The site began scraping voting data from social media posts in 2016, though its accuracy has somewhat waned over the years as \u201cpeople are now posting less and less to Instagram \u2026 and instead favour more ephemeral means of sharing, like stories,\u201d says 100 Warm Tunas creator Nick Whyte. Even so, tipsters would do well to believe his predictions: Whyte has correctly picked three of the last five winners, and this year\u2019s data is even more promising. Good Luck, Babe! (Roan\u2019s only eligible song) appears in 27% of voting slips collected by 100 Warm Tunas and Murder on the Dancefloor in 21% \u2013 whereas Whyte says previous years\u2019 top contenders have sat closer to 18%. Pop and lock it It has been exactly a decade since the Taylor Swift debacle where fans started a voting campaign for the megastar\u2019s track Shake It Off \u2013 which was later disqualified from the countdown. The hubbub now seems curiously old-fashioned in the face of genre-agnostic audiences and a Triple J playlist that includes a healthy dose of pop. \u201cThe music in the Hottest 100 is more varied nowadays,\u201d says Triple J music director Nick Findlay. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more voters celebrate a much broader musical taste in general with their votes split across different artists and genres.\u201d To no surprise, the countdown will be inundated with songs from Charli xcx\u2019s Brat and its remix album, last year\u2019s pop phenomenon which saturated the world (and certain political campaigns) in radioactive green. The British dance doyenne is slated to appear eight times in the countdown according to 100 Warm Tunas, with two tracks in the top 10. Her highest ranker is Guess, a squelching, lascivious collaboration with Hottest 100 favourite Billie Eilish \u2013 who has placed in the top 10 four times in the last five years and will probably appear at the pointy end again with her lovesick declaration Birds of a Feather. Other pop stars likely to join the fray include Taylor Swift protege Gracie Abrams with That\u2019s So True, a motor-mouthed kiss-off to an ex that became a fan favourite on TikTok; Tove Lo, with her Dom Dolla collaboration Cave; and Addison Rae, whose swooning single Diet Pepsi catapulted her from TikTok influencer to bona fide pop insider last year. But what about the Australians? Sharp-eyed pundits may notice a lack of original Australian songs in this year\u2019s predicted top 10. Joining Chappell Roan, Royel Otis, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish in the top spots are Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us; British singer-songwriter Lola Young\u2019s snarling break-up anthem Messy; Irish punk act Fontaines DC\u2019s four-minute panic attack Starburster; DJ Fred Again\u2019s fleet-footed Places To Be ; and another Charli remix \u2013 Girl, So Confusing, with Lorde. Only one local track appears alongside them: One Bad Day, a howling plea for deliverance by Perth band Spacey Jane. Data from 100 Warm Tunas, though, does have a bevy of Australian peers clocking in just behind the top 10, including Dom Dolla, Amyl and the Sniffers, The Rions, G Flip \u2013 with a cover of Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer \u2013 and Hottest 100 mainstays Ball Park Music, who have appeared 13 times in the countdown to date. Australian music has suffered on Australian charts of late. In 2024, just five out of 100 songs on Aria\u2019s year-end charts were Australian \u2013 and the highest-ranking was Vance Joy\u2019s decade-old Riptide. Last year, the number of local songs in the Hottest 100 was the lowest it had been in 10 years, at 52 tracks. Findlay says Triple J does \u201cconsistently play well over 50% of Australian music every week\u201d \u2013 above its mandated quota of 40%. And, he says, \u201c8 out of the 10 most played artists on Triple J were all local acts\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s a sign of the times: a confluence of streaming domination and cultural cringe. Or maybe we just really loved Brat. Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100 will be broadcast from midday on Saturday 25 January",

        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 is out in front with the nominations for the 67th Grammy awards in what promises to be another female-heavy year. The star has scored 11 nods for her country album Cowboy Carter with recognition in the country, pop and Americana categories. It\u2019s the biggest number of nominations she has received in a single year and she now holds the joint record of most-nominated artist ever alongside her husband, Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 is also the most awarded artist in Grammys history with 32 wins, yet has not won album of the year to date. In that category she faces competition from Andr\u00e9 3000, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Jacob Collier, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift. Following Beyonc\u00e9 with seven nominations each are Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish. Then with six each is Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter. Breakout star Roan continues a highly successful year and will be one of the favourites in the new artist category alongside Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii, Khruangbin, Raye, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims. The record of the year category contains The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Texas Hold \u2018Em, Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso, Charli xcx \u2013 360, Kendrick Lemar \u2013 Not Like Us, Chappell Roan \u2013 Good Luck Babe and Taylor Swift and Post Malone \u2013 Fortnight. The song of the year category includes Shaboozey\u2019s A Bar Song (Tipsy), Billie Eilish\u2019s Birds of a Feather, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019s Die with a Smile, Taylor Swift and Post Malone\u2019s Fortnight, Chappell Roan\u2019s Good Luck Babe, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s Please Please Please and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Texas Hold \u2018Em. The dance categories also saw recognition for Justice, Troye Sivan and Disclosure while the rock categories were led by The Black Keys and Green Day. The controversial star Chris Brown, who was the subject of a new documentary detailing various allegations of abuse and sexual assault, was featured prominently in the R&amp;B categories alongside Muni Long and Lucky Daye. Lamar was the most-nominated rap artist and faces competition in those categories from Eminem and J Cole. Dolly Parton, Jimmy Carter and Barbra Streisand also feature in the unusual line-up for this year\u2019s audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais are featured in the comedy album line-up. The recording academy\u2019s CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, called music a \u201cpowerful force for good\u201d in his introduction to today\u2019s announcement. The awards are voted on by a body of 13,000 members. No new categories were added for the first time in four years. Earlier this year, Taylor Swift became the first artist to win album of the year for the fourth time, taking home the award for Midnights. The 67th Grammy awards will take place on 2 February 2025 with a host for the ceremony yet to be announced.",

With four nominations apiece, Dua Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith are close on the pop star\u2019s trail. xcx is nominated for album, artist and song of the year \u2013 the latter for the remix of Guess featuring Billie Eilish \u2013 and in the dance and pop genre categories. But despite xcx painting the British music industry\u2019s annual party a violent shade of lime green, women remain underrepresented in this year\u2019s nominations, accounting for 34.7% of the 98 slots. Male acts comprise more than half, at 53%, with mixed-gender acts and collaborations \u2013 including the Last Dinner Party \u2013 making up the remaining 12.3%. It\u2019s a noteworthy year for some vintage groups: the Beatles\u2019 AI-abetted Now and Then is up for best song, the group\u2019s first nomination since the very first Brit awards in 1977. (Prior to becoming an annual fixture in 1983, the first Brits marked Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s silver jubilee and 100 years since the invention of the phonograph, and honoured the preceding 25 years in music, seeing the Beatles earn three nominations.) And with three nominations for Songs of a Lost World \u2013 their first album since 2008 \u2013 the Cure score their first Brit nominations in more than 30 years in the categories for album of the year, group of the year and alt/rock act. At the newer end of the scale, Stargazing singer Smith is this year\u2019s Rising Star winner, tipped by the industry for major success, and is also nominated for new artist, song and pop act. The genre categories are assembled by the Brits voting academy and then voted for by members of the public via WhatsApp. Predictably, the category for hip-hop/grime/rap act features just one woman, Little Simz, alongside Central Cee, Dave, Ghetts and Stormzy. London jazz act Ezra Collective may also be set for a breakthrough year. The five-piece released their third album, Dance, No One\u2019s Watching, in September, after winning the 2023 Mercury prize for their second album. \u201cFrom a youth club to the Brit awards and beyond,\u201d they said in a statement. Some may raise eyebrows at a group active since 2016 being up for new artist \u2013 alongside last year\u2019s Mercury winners English Teacher, the Last Dinner Party, Myles Smith and former Brit School student Rachel Chinouriri \u2013 but the category parameters stipulate that acts must have had one Top 40 album or single in the eligibility period, but can\u2019t have had a Top 10 album or more than one Top 10 single, nor have had prior nominations for best artist, group or album. Despite middling reviews for her third album Radical Optimism \u2013 which spent just 19 weeks in the UK Top 100, compared to 220 for her 2020 record Future Nostalgia \u2013 Lipa is nominated for album of the year, artist of the year, song of the year (for Training Season) and pop act. Last year\u2019s major winner, Raye \u2013 who took home six prizes in 2024 \u2013 is up for R&amp;B act. \u201cI\u2019m still processing the ridiculousness that was last year!\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited to watch Charli xcx clean up this year, she just deserves it so much.\u201d Some nascent comebacks also feature: Sam Fender is up for artist of the year and alt/rock act, despite only having released two singles from his forthcoming third album, People Watching, due in February; and Jade, of the on-hiatus band Little Mix, is up for song of the year (for Angel of My Dreams) and pop act. In the international categories, Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Billie Eilish have two nods apiece; Eilish also clocks a third nomination alongside xcx in the song category. \u201cThank you so much for the nominations and the recognition of my art,\u201d Roan said in a statement. \u201cThe UK has always shown me so much love and championed me through these past few years. It was one of the first places that Good Luck, Babe! blew up in, so this feels extra special.\u201d The awards for producer and songwriter of the year will be announced prior to the ceremony, which takes place on 1 March at the O2 Arena in London. Returning for the first time since 2021, Jack Whitehall reclaims hosting duties. No performers have yet been announced for the night.

        "trailText": "An unusual ceremony paid tribute to and raised money for those affected by the California wildfires while giving Beyonc\u00e9 her first album of the year",
        "bodyText": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar ruled the Grammys during a night that also paid tribute to those affected by the California wildfires. The night\u2019s biggest prize, for album of the year, went to Beyonc\u00e9 for Cowboy Carter, the first time she has won the award. It was presented by members of the Los Angeles country fire department in one of many of the night\u2019s tributes to those affected by the wildfires. The ceremony took place at the Crypto.com arena in LA. The singer is only the fourth Black woman to win the award. \u201cIt\u2019s been many many years,\u201d she said to loud applause. A visibly shocked Beyonc\u00e9 also won for best country album, saying she \u201creally was not expecting this\u201d as she accepted the award. \u201cSometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists and I just want to encourage people to do what they\u2019re passionate about,\u201d she said. She was given the award by Taylor Swift. \u201cI will never forget standing here almost exactly 15 years ago,\u201d she said while looking back on her win in this category. Beyonc\u00e9, who also won for best country duo performance with Miley Cyrus, became the first Black woman to win a country Grammy for 50 years. Chris Stapleton took home the award for best country solo performance. Lamar won five awards for his controversial Drake diss track Not Like Us, which is currently the subject of a defamation lawsuit. He took home both song and record of the year. During one of his speeches, Lamar, who is performing at next week\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, said he wanted to \u201cdedicate this one to the city\u201d. After last year saw Taylor Swift, SZA, Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish dominate, this year saw another strong female showing with Beyonc\u00e9, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, Doechii and Chappell Roan winning many of the major awards. In the competitive best new artist category, Chappell Roan beat out Shaboozey, Raye, Benson Boone and Sabrina Carpenter. She used her speech to call on the industry to \u201coffer a livable wage and healthcare especially to emerging artists\u201d before telling the story of how she struggled to survive in her early days as a musician. \u201cLabels, we got you but do you got us?\u201d she asked. Charli xcx picked up three awards in the pop categories but lost out on pop solo performance and pop vocal album to Sabrina Carpenter. Doechii won for best rap album, becoming only the third woman to do so. Other female winners included SZA who picked up best R&amp;B song for Saturn, St Vincent who took home best alternative music album, best rock song and best alternative music performance, Kacey Musgraves who picked up best country song for The Architect and Shakira who won best Latin pop album. The Colombian singer dedicated her award to \u201call my immigrant brothers and sisters\u201d. Jimmy Carter was also a posthumous winner for the audio book category while Dave Chappelle and Chris Brown were controversial picks for comedy album and R&amp;B album respectively. Host Trevor Noah began the night by referring to the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances that have changed the tone and motivation of this year\u2019s awards. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest national disasters in American history,\u201d he said while speaking about the devastating California wildfires and calling attention to the spirit of those who have endured. To kick off the show, he introduced Dawes, a band who have lost homes and instruments as a result of the fires. They have also helped raise money for nearly 100 other families. They were joined by artists including John Legend, Sheryl Crow and St Vincent for a special performance paying tribute to Los Angeles. Noah drew attention to a number of charities and organisations, telling those in the room and viewers at home that there would be a QR code which would allow people to contribute. He later said that Amazon Music, CBS and Mastercard had donated. He also said the night would highlight local businesses affected by the fires with the venue both catered and decorated by some and with a certain amount of advertising space given to others. While presenting the award for song of the year, Diana Ross said: \u201cMay this moment remind us all of the power we hold to rebuild, to lift and to come together with compassion.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars performed a duet of California Dreamin\u2019 after a montage highlighting Californians who had lost their homes in the fires. The pair later won the best pop duo performance award for their song Die with a Smile. In her acceptance speech, she said: \u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up.\u201d Noah had a number of jabs at the returning US president, joking that millions of immigrants were also part of this year\u2019s voting body. When speaking about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s just-announced tour, he joked: \u201cThere\u2019s tariffs, we can\u2019t afford a new tour! Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Alicia Keys was given the Dr Dre global impact award and spoke to the importance of diversity in music. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry,\u201d she said. She also added that \u201cthis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices\u201d and that \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift\u201d. Other performances throughout the night included Billie Eilish who ended her performance saying \u201cI love LA\u201d, Sabrina Carpenter who sang a rejigged and physically comedic take on her hits Espresso and Please Please Please, Chappell Roan who was introduced by Olivia Rodrigo (the Vampire singer called her \u201cmy extraordinary friend\u201d) and a surprise appearance from the Weeknd who had previously pledged a permanent boycott of the Grammys. His performance was introduced by the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who spoke about the many structural changes he had helped implement which then lured the Weeknd back. There was also a star-studded tribute to Quincy Jones who died last year. Will Smith, making his first appearance on a major televised awards ceremony since the infamous slap, called Jones \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our time\u201d in an introduction to a performance that featured Janelle Monae, Herbie Hancock, Cynthia Erivo and Stevie Wonder, who led a rendition of We Are the World with a choir wearing special LA sweaters. Smith explained that the singers represented two schools that had been lost in the fires. Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin also sang an accompaniment to this year\u2019s in memoriam section which included late stars including Liam Payne, Kris Kristofferson, Cissy Houston, Marianne Faithfull, Bob Newhart, Wayne Osmond and S\u00e9rgio Mendes. Last year saw Taylor Swift become the first artist to win album of the year four times but tonight she went home empty-handed despite six nominations. Other nominees who left without any awards included Shaboozey, Post Malone, Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish.",

        "bodyText": "Wow, what a ride. This year\u2019s Grammys felt both five hours and 40 minutes long, a mostly smooth affair that was assumedly a relief to organizers \u2013 homage paid to first responders, LA consistently shouted out and no one can say Beyonc\u00e9 was snubbed again. The Cowboy Carter artist was a sparse presence at the show but emerged gracious and triumphant, winning best country album \u2013 the first Black female artist to do so \u2013 and album of the year. Intentionally or not, the Grammys spread the love around this year \u2013 Kendrick Lamar won the most awards of the evening with five, followed by Beyonc\u00e9 and Charli xcx with three each. Plenty of time went to celebrating a diverse crop of new artists \u2013 Sabrina Carpenter, Doechii and best new artist winner Chappell Roan, among others \u2013 as well as the resilience of wildfire survivors. Four hours, nine awards, many tributes and one very bad night for Drake later, the Grammys are through. Thanks for sticking with us! See you next year. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Lee\u2019s nice wrap of the evening: Obligatory post on infamously enthusiastic attendee Taylor Swift\u2019s award show: trying brat and catching Janelle Monae\u2019s jacket. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a snippet from Charli xcx\u2019s performance of Guess, once again answering the question \u201cwhat is Brat?\u201d Most of the awards weren\u2019t televised tonight \u2013 only nine made the broadcast \u2013 so my colleague Benjamin Lee helpfully compiled a full list of winners: Here\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s brief yet poignant acceptance speech for album of the year, with Blue Ivy in tow. As Trevor Noah said: finally! Thank god \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is FINALLY an album of the year Grammy winner, for Cowboy Carter. There\u2019s a sense of relief to this win, for an artist who long ago deserved it, and is now only the fourth Black female artist to win it. Beyonc\u00e9, accompanied on stage by her daughter Blue Ivy (how is she this grown?!), keeps it short and sweet: \u201cI just feel very full and very honored,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been many, many years and I just want to thank the Grammys, every songwriter, every collaborator, every producer, all the hard work.\u201d And she offered a special final dedication to Black country trailblazer Linda Martell \u2013 \u201cI hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors,\u201d she said. \u201cGod bless y\u2019all.\u201d There\u2019s one final, poignant tribute for the evening, as dozens of Los Angeles firefighters present the award for album of the year. Fire chief Anthony Marrone thanked first responders \u201cwho came from near and far\u201d to battle the flames. \u201cTheir selfless acts of courage and commitment were nothing short of inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\u201d He got the longest standing ovation of the evening, of course. Brat was the dominant music story of the year, the ultimate album cycle and meme of 2024, and Charli xcx was rewarded with the final performance of the night at the Grammys. It\u2019s a very Charli performance \u2013 a car, sunglasses, strutting, underwear, a shout out to Julia Fox (it\u2019s apparently her birthday). Von Dutch and Guess (with Billie Eilish, though not on stage here) go hard at the club, and it sort of translates here. The Grammys brought out an icon for this one: Diana Ross, who pondered: \u201chow can we have the balance of celebrating and being filled with sorrow?\u201d before handing Kendrick Lamar \u2013 who has swept his categories tonight \u2013 for song of the year. \u201cI\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said, before passing off to his collaborators, all from Compton. \u201cAll the west coast artists, man,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s about, man, because at the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than rap music.\u201d \u201cWe are music,\u201d he added. Also: \u201cRespect the art form.\u201d It truly only gets worse for Drake. We\u2019re reaching the end of the night, but not before the Dr Dre Global Impact award, presented by Queen Latifah to Alicia Keys for her work as a singer, musician, producer, Keep a Child Alive charity and efforts to expand opportunities for women in music. Keys \u201cis a constant inspiration, through her voice, her talent, but most importantly through her heart\u201d, said Latifah of the 17-time Grammy winner, including today for musical theater album. Keys was especially excited to be acknowledged as a producer. \u201cI always had to fight for a certain level of respect as a songwriter and composer and especially as a producer,\u201d she said. \u201cFemale producers have always powered the industry. \u201cThis is for all the ladies that know the magic that they bring to the room,\u201d she added before a shout out to diversity. \u201cDEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d she said to cheers. \u201cAnd the more voices, the more powerful the sound. \u201cWhen destructive forces try to burn us down, we rise from the ashes like a phoenix and as you\u2019ve seen tonight, music is the universal language that connects us all,\u201d she added. \u201cLet\u2019s keep showing up with compassion, empathy \u2026 the dream of the world as it ought to be, as the great Toni Morrison said.\u201d As introduced by Gloria Estefan (!!), Shakira reminds us why she\u2019s been at this for nearly 30 years. With a lengthy, tour de force performance of bellydancing, choreography and songs from her Grammy-winning album Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, she makes the case for being a living Latin legend. If Beyonc\u00e9 had to lose \u2013 and presenter Miley Cyrus seemed determined that she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then at least she lost to collaborator Kendrick Lamar, for his Drake diss track (!) turned global smash Not Like Us. Lamar, a Compton native, was all smiles and all about LA: \u201cWe gonna dedicate this one to the city \u2013 Compton, Watts, Long Beach, Inglewood, Hollywood out to the Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my neck of the woods that\u2019s held me down since I was a young pup \u2026 I can\u2019t give enough thanks to these places that I\u2019ve rolled around in since high school.\u201d The survivors of the fires are \u201ca true testament\u201d that \u201cwe will rebuild this city\u201d, he added. Pointedly no mention of Drake, which I imagine makes this even tougher for Drake. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Chappell Roan\u2019s full speech, probably the most powerful and pointed of the evening so far. Music executives take note. We\u2019ve made it to the in memoriam segment, led by Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. It\u2019s always stirring, with nods this year to Kris Kristofferson, Marianne Faithfull, Phil Lesh and more, but I have to say \u2013 kicking off the tribute with footage of One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne, who died in October at just 31, especially got to me. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars win for Die With a Smile, a smash in some circles. The perhaps unlikely duo seem genuinely affectionate for each other, singing each other\u2019s praises \u2013 \u201cGaga, I\u2019m so honored to be part of this song with you,\u201d said Mars. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a small part of your giant musical legacy.\u201d \u201cBruno, you are an incredible human being, you are a musician for the ages,\u201d Gaga added. Gaga also added a pointed statement to the public: \u201cTrans people are not invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cTrans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love.\u201d Enough said. For those also confused by the Mastercard commercial that was maybe also Lady Gaga\u2019s return to pop form \u2013 it was indeed the music video for her new single Abracadabra. The whole thing, in service of hew upcoming album Mayhem, just dropped on Youtube: We\u2019re still tributing Jones, with country artist Lainey Wilson and musician Jacob Collier providing a slightly less smooth follow-up to Cynthia Erivo, before passing the baton to Stevie Wonder, back at the piano bench with Hancock. \u201cQuincy was always there to help,\u201d he said, remembering how Jones organized the recording session for 1985 aid anthem We Are the World, which Wonder performed with singers from Pasadena Waldorf school and Palisades Charter high school, two schools lost to the fires. And then Smith returns to tell a story about how Jones, the executive producer of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, once scolded him for not providing better food for the TV show crew. Jones\u2019s mantra was, according to Smith: \u201cIt is your job to take care of these people. And I\u2019ve done everything I can throughout my career to live up to Quincy\u2019s demand.\u201d \u201cQuincy Jones always took care of people. And that\u2019s how he fed the world,\u201d he added, before passing to the final leg of the tribute: Janelle Monae energetically riffing on arguably Jones\u2019s most famous production work \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller. Cue Taylor Swift dancing. We\u2019re on to the tributes section of the evening, with a whole segment dedicated to the late Quincy Jones, who died in November 2024 at age 91. Will Smith (in his first major awards appearance since \u2026 you know) remembered Jones as \u201cone of the most groundbreaking and influential figures of our times\u201d. A producer, arranger, film &amp; television composer, recording artist and conductor, among other roles, Jones \u201cmade so many music greats across multiple genres sound even greater, bringing the best out in legends\u201d from Ray Charles to Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. On that note, Cynthia Erivo delivers a gorgeous rendition of Sinatra\u2019s Fly Me to the Moon. Accompanied on piano by the legendary Herbie Hancock and a full jazz orchestra, she even gets Beyonc\u00e9 grooving along. We\u2019re about two-thirds of the way through \u2013 I know, it\u2019s hard to tell when there\u2019s only been five awards \u2013 and so far, this seems like another big night for the women of music. Female artists \u2013 Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 have won all of the televised awards so far, a year after Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and SZA dominated the Grammys telecast. Remember when former academy president Neil Portnow said female artists needed to \u201cstep up\u201d? Well. It\u2019s nice to see the Grammys come around. Another superstar combo (and Super Bowl halftime show reunion) as Jennifer Lopez presents best Latin pop album to Shakira. The Colombian singer dedicated the win to \u201cmy immigrant brothers and sisters in this country. \u201cYou are loved, you are worth it. I will always fight with you,\u201d she said in one of just a few direct political statements tonight. \u201cAnd to all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for your families \u2013 you are the true she wolves.\u201d The recording academy is very delighted that the Weeknd decided to perform, settling his public criticism of the Grammys, at least for now. I admittedly didn\u2019t recognize these songs on first listen, as they\u2019re from his new album Hurry Up Tomorrow, the final edition of his After Hours trilogy released this weekend. We\u2019re a little over halfway through the show, and Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the recording academy, is here to giveeveryone a vibe check. Mason, who took over the academy during the tumult of 2020, said he \u201cwanted the organization to change and modernize so we could be better and serve this dynamic and global music community\u201d. But he faced some challenges, such as when the Weeknd blasted the Grammys for lack of transparency over their nominations process. Mason may have been stung, but \u201cI heard him. I felt his conviction,\u201d he said, because \u201cwhat we all want is an organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all music makers\u201d. This is the part of the show where the recording academy touts itself, but Mason does note some real changes: new advocacy groups for Black, LGBTQ+ and female artists, as well as a younger and more diverse voting base, with 66% new membership. Enough change that even the Weeknd decided to grace the Grammys with his presence again. Including that video interlude and the Lady Gaga \u2013 Bruno Mars tribute, the Grammys have mostly made good on their promise to prioritize wildfire relief and celebrate LA\u2019s resilience. Some commercial breaks have contained segments dedicated to local businesses impacted by the fires, such as a local floral shop destroyed by the Altadena fire near Pasadena which is already rebuilding. And a QR code has frequently appeared on screen linking to a site for wildfire relief donations. \u201cI thought what Chappell said there was absolutely beautiful,\u201d said Trevor Noah, transitioning to a very, very serious note on the wildfires. Noah reminded the audience to remember what happened, then introduced a video showing it \u2013 charred homes, lost possessions, many tears. Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga follow up with a \u2026 very committed rendition of The Mamas &amp; the Papas\u2019 California Dreamin\u2019. No surprise here \u2013 Chappell Roan, last year\u2019s breakout star on the festival circuit, is this year\u2019s best new artist. Wearing a princess hat and carrying a journal, the 26-year-old used her time to call for record labels to provide better wages and healthcare to up-and-coming artists, recalling the time just a few years ago when she was dropped by her label and couldn\u2019t afford healthcare. \u201cIf my label would have prioritized artists\u2019 health, I could have been provided care by a company I was giving everything to,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels, we got you, but do you got us?\u201d It was a powerful moment that got a standing ovation \u2013 full speech forthcoming. And South London artist Raye brings this new artist medley home with a jazz-inflected, classically showstopping performance. The successful songwriter \u2013 who has penned tracks for Charli xcx, John Legend, Rita Ora, Jennifer Lopez, Little Mix, Beyonc\u00e9 and more \u2013 has seemingly cemented her status as a singer in her own right, with a lengthy standing ovation and a nod by Trevor Noah. Continuing this genre tour of best new artist nominees, Teddy Swims delivers a soulful rendition of his hit Lose Control before passing the baton to Shaboozey and his country smash Bar Song (Tipsy). The (admittedly loose) interpolation J-Kwon\u2019s 2004 banger Tipsy, which was inescapable last summer, brings everyone including Jennifer Lopez to their feet. Next up is Doechii, with a school girl-themed performance of Denial is a River. The newly minted best rap album winner demonstrated some virtuosic rapping \u2013 enough to earn a standing ovation from Jay Z, a visible \u201coh my god!\u201d from Billie Eilish and an enthusiastic cheer from SZA. We\u2019re onto a showcase for the best new artist category \u2013 first up is Benson Boone, the 22-year-old singer of Beautiful Things who seems to be making an appeal to women a few decades older, as Heidi Klum and Nikki Glaser assisted his costume reveal. His octave-spanning performance did draw a standing ovation from J Lo \u2026 Well well well, the Grammys must be pleased to have this collision of superstars, as Taylor Swift presents Beyonc\u00e9 with the award for best country album. Beyonc\u00e9, the winning-est Grammy artist of all time, although famously locked out of major awards, seemed genuinely shocked to win for an album made, in part, in response to the treatment she received at the 2016 CMA Awards. \u201cWow, I really was not expecting this,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to thank God that I\u2019m able to still do what I love after so many years.\u201d Now the first Black woman to win a country music Grammy in over 50 years, Beyonc\u00e9 also thanked \u201call of the incredible country artists who accepted this album\u201d and her family (Blue is in attendance!). \u201cI think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\u201d she added, \u201cand I want to encourage people to do what they are passionate about and stay persistent.\u201d Olivia Rodrigo introduces tonight\u2019s third best new artist frontrunner (along with Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii): Chappell Roan, whom Rodrigo knew when Roan was still a struggling artist working at a donut shop in LA\u2019s Highland Park. With a rodeo clown-themed performance that involved, naturally, a jumbo pink pony, the Willard, Missouri, native sang Pink Pony Club \u2013 a song she recorded and released in 2021 before getting dropped by her label and working at said donut shop. The song, as she said in a pre-recorded segment, is a \u201clove letter to LA\u201d, a place that \u201cgave me the courage to be myself\u201d. Everything is coming up roses for Sabrina Carpenter, who wins best pop vocal album in a stacked category that included Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and fellow best new artist nominee Chappell Roan. \u201cI really was not expecting this,\u201d said Carpenter, still out of breath from her performance a few minutes ago. She thanked her mom \u201cfor driving me to every voice lesson\u201d, her dad, sisters and all the producers on Short n\u2019 Sweet. Carpenter also shouted out LA, as did presenters Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who sang an a cappella section of Under the Bridge in tribute to their home city. Oh wow, a huge win for the women of rap and the up-and-comers: Doechii, the 26-year-old Florida-based rapper also nominated for best new artist, wins best album, as presented by an on-form Cardi B. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this long but this category was introduced in 1989 and two women have won \u2013 three women have won! \u2013 Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii,\u201d she said through tears. The \u201cSwamp Princess\u201d thanked her mother, with whom she shared the stage, as well as her hometown of Tampa, Florida. \u201cWhenever people think about Florida, they think about Miami but \u2026 there\u2019s so much talent in Tampa,\u201d she said. And she ended with a triumphant call to Black women: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can do it. Anything is possible \u2026 you are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are and I am a testimony.\u201d 2024 was a massive year for the pop girls, and Sabrina Carpenter reminds everyone why. The pint-sized best new artist nominee, one of the breakout stars of the year, brought her pin-up style to the Grammys for a jazzy, characteristically cheeky take on her summer smash Espresso and follow-up Please Please Please with a set inspired by \u2013 naturally \u2013 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It\u2019s fitting for tonight\u2019s theme that the first nominee performance of the evening comes from local legends Billie Eilish and Finneas, the siblings from Highland Park. The duo and a band perform their inescapable hit Birds of a Feather with an LA-based background, which (unsurprisingly) gets Taylor Swift to her feet and ends with a sweet note of \u201cI love you, LA.\u201d Following Doors, Noah gets right back on the mic to answer everyone\u2019s burning question: is Beyonc\u00e9 here? Not yet, but maybe soon? \u201cYes, Beyonc\u00e9 will be here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I hope she\u2019ll be here. I can\u2019t make her do anything.\u201d Roving about the crowd, particularly hovering around Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan, Noah took the lightest of digs at the night\u2019s big stars, starting with the biggest. Beyonc\u00e9 has 11 nominations and just announced her 2025 Cowboy Carter tour: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a new tour. Maple syrup is about to be $50.\u201d Noah joked about the \u201cpower of AI\u201d: \u201cmaybe one day, we could get another Rihanna album\u201d \u2013 and Swift\u2019s Eras Tour. \u201cShe got more Americans traveling than those Turkish hair transplants,\u201d he joked. And he alluded to Trump\u2019s presidency as \u201cchanges\u201d in Washington DC. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy tonight, because this may be the last time I\u2019m allowed to host anything in this country,\u201d he joked. Well \u2026 oof. And we\u2019re off! Host Trevor Noah kicks things off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: it\u2019s weird to have an award show in LA so close to the devastating wildfires. \u201cThis city has just been through one of the largest natural disasters in American history,\u201d he said. Thanks to heroic firefighters, \u201cthe fires have now been contained\u201d, he continued. \u201cAnd despite all the devastation, the spirit of the city has endured.\u201d Noah summarily explained the mission of the evening: celebrate music, yes, but also \u201cthe city that brought us so much of that music\u201d. He shouted out the LA inspirations for hometown heroes Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg, as well as Chappell Roan and Stevie Wonder, before introducing local band Doors, who lost multiple homes and their studio in the fires, for an opening performance with an all-star band including John Legend, Sheryl Crow, St Vincent, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard. Repeating the mantra \u201cWe Love LA,\u201d they bring the crowd to their feet. Tonight will feature a starry tribute to Quincy Jones who died last November. Here\u2019s a look back to a great tribute from Alexis Petridis: It\u2019s close to show time, so the A-list pop stars are finally here, led by Taylor Swift in a sparkly red mini dress reminiscent of her Eras Tour stage costumes. Best new artist nominees making the most of their Grammy moment: Also a banner year of country-pop crossovers, continuing on the red carpet (no Beyonc\u00e9 yet!) This video of returning host Trevor Noah getting ready for the night is less interesting for his preparation and more for the slight seating chart reveals \u2026 A banner year for the women of pop continues on the red carpet: Will Beyonce finally win album of the year? Who will be named best \u201cnew\u201d artist out of Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan? Can Kendrick Lamar piss Drake off even more? Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Ben Beaumont-Thomas having a guess: Well, we seem to have a winner for most baffling red carpet outfit \u2026 Jaden Smith and his head/housepiece. After teasing and then delaying a big announcement (a result of the wildfires), tonight\u2019s most-nominated star, Beyonc\u00e9, has now officially revealed that she will be going on tour this year to support her most recent album, Cowboy Carter. Here\u2019s the teaser she released on Instagram: If there\u2019s one thing the Grammys love, it\u2019s a controversial award choice \u2013 despite a decade-plus worth of abuse allegations outlined a recent documentary, the recording academy gave Chris Brown the award for best R&amp;B album for 11:11. The film, Chris Brown: A History of Violence, includes testimony from a woman who sued Brown for sexual assault in 2022 and explicitly asks why he is still embraced by fans and the music industry. Brown has sued Warner Bros Discovery over the film, claiming defamation. There will also likely be blowback over noted transphobe Dave Chappelle\u2019s win for best comedy album, his third win in a row in that category and sixth overall. The majority of tonight\u2019s winners have been revealed before the official ceremony kicks off, as is the weird way of the Grammys. There\u2019s an awful lot to burn through so perhaps it\u2019s a relief for those of us in for the long-haul. Here are some of the winners we have so far: Best dance/electronic music album Charli xcx \u2013 Brat Best pop solo performance Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 Espresso Best rock performance The Beatles \u2013 Now and Then Best rap performance Kendrick Lamar \u2013 Not Like Us Best country duo/group performance Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Miley Cyrus \u2013 II Most Wanted Best dance pop recording Charli xcx \u2013 Von Dutch Best R&amp;B song SZA \u2013 Saturn Best rock album The Rolling Stones \u2013 Hackney Diamonds Best dance/electronic recording Justice and Tame Impala \u2013 Neverender It was a question asked by many within the industry: will the Grammys still go ahead? The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and the Critics Choice awards postponed, but the Recording Academy has stuck to the original date, hoping the night can act as a moment of coming together for an industry hugely affected by the wildfires. Here\u2019s a bit more about what to expect from an unusual ceremony: The red carpet is open and the musicians are here \u2013 welcome to the 67th annual Grammy awards, live from the Crypto.com arena (formerly and forever the Staples Center) in Los Angeles. This year promises to be a bit more somber than usual, as the Grammys take place just a couple weeks after wildfires devastated the city. After some debate over whether to postpone the ceremony, the recording academy decided to let the show go on, albeit with a \u201crenewed sense of purpose\u201d and fundraising efforts. As for the awards, of which there will be few in the music-heavy telecast \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 leads the night with 11 nominations for Cowboy Carter, followed by Kendrick Lamar, Charli xcx, Post Malone and Billie Eilish with seven each. Will Beyonc\u00e9 finally win album of the year? Will Brat summer dominance continue? How will the vibes be on this edition of \u201cmusic\u2019s biggest night\u201d? Stick with us for all the highlights.",

        "headline": "Brat awards! Charli xcx wins five Brits for zeitgeist-conquering album",
        "trailText": "Dance-pop artist picks up album and artist of the year prizes, while Ezra Collective see off big names to become first jazz artists to win British group",
        "bodyText": "Charli xcx has won five Brit awards, including album of the year for her summer-defining, green-hued, magnificently debauched album Brat. At the ceremony in London\u2019s O2 Arena, she was also awarded British artist of the year, song of the year for Guess (featuring Billie Eilish), and one of the five genre awards, for dance act. Earlier in the week she was named songwriter of the year. The wins cap a zeitgeist-surfing year for the singer, whose knowingly trashy sound and look was so distinctive it gave rise to a whole cultural phenomenon: \u201cBrat summer\u201d, plus various things being declared \u201cbrat\u201d. It was nebulously defined \u2013 Charli asserted that the seemingly un-brat Kamala Harris was, in fact, brat \u2013 but centred around untrammelled raving, unclean living and unbothered cool. Brat topped the UK chart and has spent 38 weeks in the Top 20, and was critically acclaimed for its range: between the club bangers lay a series of thoughtful, romantic and emotionally raw tracks that laid bare Charli\u2019s anxieties about fame and potential motherhood. It was also a success in the US, reaching No 3 and winning three Grammys. She thanked some of her dance music heroes \u2013 resulting in probably the first mention of Autechre at the Brit awards \u2013 as well as Eilish for turning her contribution to Guess around in a handful of days, saying: \u201cNot all artists are [as] spontaneous, despite claiming that they are.\u201d On winning album of the year, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like an outsider ... particularly in the British music industry. So it feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven\u2019t made any sacrifices.\u201d She told her fellow artists: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to compromise your vision.\u201d The chief architect of Brat\u2019s dance-pop sound, AG Cook, won the Brit award for producer of the year. He also released a solo album during the awards\u2019 eligibility period, entitled Britpop. Charli \u2013 real name Charlotte Aitchison, 32 \u2013 first released music back in 2008, but these are her first Brit award wins following four previous nominations. Only one artist has ever won more Brits in a single year: Raye, who set the record last year with six, and who has now added to her overall haul by winning R&amp;B act for the second year in a row. Another act adding to a 2024 win was the Last Dinner Party. The flamboyant five-piece were given the rising star award last year, and have now picked up best new artist. Playing an expansive style of classic rock and alt-pop, their debut album Prelude to Ecstasy went to No 1 in February 2024, and they have become regarded as one of the UK\u2019s best live acts. Bassist Georgia Davies said they \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a band without the UK\u2019s incredible independent venues \u2013 they are the lifebood of the industry, and they are dying\u201d. She called on arena operators to financially support grassroots venues, and told artists who play the latter to \u201ckeep going, because that\u2019s the best kind of art there is\u201d. The Last Dinner Party lost out in the British group category, though, to a giantkilling underdog: jazz quintet Ezra Collective, who also beat Coldplay, the Cure and Bring Me the Horizon. Playing propulsive instrumentals influenced by Fela Kuti as well as hip-hop, funk and spiritual jazz, they are the leading light in London\u2019s recently resurgent jazz scene. Like the Last Dinner Party, their live show is hugely acclaimed, and in November they became the first British jazz act to play London\u2019s 12,500-capacity Wembley Arena. They\u2019re also the first jazz group to win a Brit award, and in 2023 they became the first jazz act to win the Mercury prize. After picking up the award, bandleader Femi Koleoso appealed for support for youth clubs and music education, saying: \u201cSo many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, we\u2019re unsure of how to fix, but the solution likes with giving a young person a trumpet, a saxophone \u2013 because when you do that you give them an aspiration, a goal.\u201d In the genre categories \u2013 which were voted for by the public \u2013 Sam Fender picked up the rock/alternative act prize for the second time, in the week he hit No 1 with his third album People Watching: the fastest-selling vinyl album by a British artist this century, and the biggest opening week for a British artist since Harry Styles in 2022. Waggishly introduced by host Jack Whitehall as \u201ca man who has put more smiles on Geordie faces than a Turkish dentist\u201d, Fender also performed his new album\u2019s title track. Former Little Mix member Jade beat Charli xcx to best pop act, having transitioned into a successful solo career with the hit single Angel of My Dreams. She adds to her three wins with Little Mix, including in 2021 when they became the first female act to win British group. She also beat Dua Lipa, who had a night to forget, not winning any of her four nominated categories. He may have won three Brits in the past and remains a commercial heavyweight, but Stormzy was something of a surprise winner in the hip-hop/grime/rap category. Central Cee had been the favourite, having become the country\u2019s most globally popular rapper in recent years (though, like Fender, his recent No 1 album Can\u2019t Rush Greatness isn\u2019t eligible until next year\u2019s Brits). As well as quoting a Bible psalm and saying he had bruised his cornea playing Padel, Stormzy namechecked Central Cee in his acceptance speech, saying that while he was grateful for the win, \u201cI don\u2019t entirely think this award should be fan-voted \u2026 sometimes I think it doesn\u2019t let people have their moments. Cench was the rap artist of the year.\u201d The public vote was between mid-January and mid-February, meaning that the outcry at Stormzy\u2019s recent McDonald\u2019s campaign did not affect his votes. This year\u2019s rising star award was given in December to singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was nominated for three further awards, including song of the year for his huge hit Stargazing, which he performed at the ceremony along with Nice to Meet You. Picking up the award, the working-class Luton musician addressed the British government: \u201cIf British music is one of the most powerful cultural exports we have, why have you treated it like an afterthought for so many years?\u201d \u201cWe have to protect the foundations that make it,\u201d he added. Like the Last Dinner Party, he appealed to arena operators to support British grassroots venues, and asked the music industry: \u201cAre we building careers, or are we just chasing moments \u2026 please stick with artists past a viral hit.\u201d It was a sentiment shared by Chappell Roan, who called for artists to \u201cnot be pressured into making music based off what is trending\u201d as she picked up the international song award for Good Luck, Babe! The US pop singer-songwriter also won the award for international artist, which she dedicated to \u201ctrans artists, drag queens, fashion students, sex workers and Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor.\u201d Irish rockers Fontaines DC picked up international group, their second win in that category. Introduced by Diana Ross and Millie Bobby Brown, Sabrina Carpenter was given the reactivated global success award, following a year in which she had three UK No 1 singles plus a No 1 album. She thanked her British fans, saying: \u201cIn a primarily tea-drinking country, you\u2019ve streamed the shit out of Espresso \u2026 cheerio!\u201d Carpenter opened the live show to the strains of Rule, Britannia! with dancers dressed as Buckingham Palace guards, segueing into a performance of the chart-topping Espresso and then a watershed testing, raunchy rendition of Bed Chem. The show also featured performances from Jade, the Last Dinner Party, British singer Lola Young, US singer Teddy Swims, and Ezra Collective, who performed alongside London youth group Kinetika Bloco and two-time Brit winner Jorja Smith. Whitehall, who previously hosted the show between 2018 and 2021, returned with a hail of good-natured jibes targeting the likes of Simon Cowell, KSI, Coldplay (\u201cthe public school Nickelback\u201d) and even the previous day\u2019s \u201ccringe\u201d Zelenskyy-Trump meeting. He skirted the boundaries of good taste with one comment about Jade\u2019s live performance, saying: \u201cI really thought Diddy might have done it for the white party theme\u201d, and later referenced sex toys and an adult film actor \u2013 all of it casting the Brits as the award season\u2019s bawdiest, booziest event. But he also led a heartfelt in memoriam segment to Liam Payne, calling him an \u201cincredibly kind soul\u201d. Aside from the publicly voted genre categories, the Brits are voted for by the 1,338-strong Brits Academy, populated by musicians as well as industry and media figures.

        "trailText": "Playing music that is as smart as it is successful, Brit winners made articulate calls for artist development \u2013 while host Jack Whitehall was brilliantly risky",
        "bodyText": "The Brits has long been in the business of underlining success; upsets and shock wins aren\u2019t really the point. If they seemed moderately more exciting in 2025 than in years past, that\u2019s partly because Jack Whitehall is a better, riskier, funnier host than anyone else offered the job in recent years \u2013 he mocked Stormzy for his promotion of McDonald\u2019s, made a joke about amyl nitrate and called Coldplay \u201cthe musical missionary position\u201d \u2013 and because 2024 was a vintage year for mainstream pop, dominated by music that was characterful and hugely successful. If Charli xcx \u2013 and producer AG Cook \u2013 hadn\u2019t been lavishly rewarded for her agenda-setting album Brat, you would have wondered what had gone wrong: likewise Chappell Roan, whose ardent emotion both in and out of the recording studio makes her one of pop\u2019s most cheering recent developments: she responded to her two awards with acceptance speeches that called upon the music industry to offer more long-term development support to artists \u2013 a theme also picked up on by Myles Smith, winner of the rising star award \u2013 and shouted out the trans community and sex workers. Cannily, the Brits managed to elbow in a third big pop name of 2024, too. The global success award was mysteriously reactivated for the first time in six years and, more mysteriously still, repurposed. Previously given to British artists who\u2019d reaped vast commercial dividends abroad \u2013 One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Adele \u2013 it went to Sabrina Carpenter, who\u2019s certainly reaped vast commercial dividends over the last 12 months, but hails from Pennsylvania. It\u2019s meant as no smear on Carpenter herself, a witty and self-knowing star whose album Short n\u2019 Sweet went to No 1 in 18 countries and contained a succession of superb, similarly chart-topping singles, but you did rather get the feeling the Brits were making up an award to give to her and \u2013 given the absence of Roan \u2013 secure her presence at the event itself. She repaid their gesture by performing Espresso with dancers dressed as Coldstream guardsmen and interpolating the song with the strains of Rule! Britannia. Among the other expected victories, Sam Fender\u2019s success came at the end of a week in which his third album entered the UK charts at No 1, selling more than 100,000 copies in the process; and Fontaines DC won international group on the back of Romance, an album that successfully managed to shift them in a more commercial direction without sacrificing any of their potency or aggression. Jade Thirlwall was rewarded for a string of solo singles that fit perfectly into the new more expansive pop zeitgeist: with its sample of Sandie Shaw\u2019s Puppet on a String and its sudden shifts in tempo and mood, Angel of My Dreams in particular was vastly more inventive and unpredictable than anything she recorded while a member of Little Mix, underlined by an episodic live performance so peculiar it stole the show. If Stormzy\u2019s victory over Central Cee in the public vote for hip-hop/grime/rap artist seemed a little surprising \u2013 as he pointed out in an acceptance speech that essentially seemed to be suggesting he didn\u2019t think he should have won, the only big hit he\u2019s recently had was from an appearance on Chase and Status\u2019s Backbone \u2013 the most striking win was Ezra Collective, and not merely because you might have expected the Cure to win best group instead (both as a nod to the success of Songs of a Lost World, their first album in 16 years, and as a kind of long-service medal). Critics have been suggesting that Ezra Collective might cross over to the mainstream for some years now, more out of hope than expectation: for all the influence they draw from hip-hop, dub, Afrobeat and dance music, they remain at heart a jazz quintet. And yet their career has recently surged. They won the Mercury prize in 2023, scored their first Top 10 album with last year\u2019s Dance, No One\u2019s Watching and became the first British jazz act to headline Wembley Arena: precisely the kind of success that the Brits should be celebrating.",

        "bodyText": "A \u201cvery different\u201d Grammy awards will take place in Los Angeles this weekend, impacted by the recent wildfires that have affected California. The annual celebration of music, taking place at the Crypto.com arena on Sunday, will still feature a range of big-name performers but there will be a noticeable shift in purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical Grammy party atmosphere,\u201d said Harvey Mason Jr, the CEO of the Recording Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s not only \u2018the show must go on\u2019 but the show must provide a greater service. Of course, we\u2019re going to honor music, but our goal is to utilise music to make a difference.\u201d The week leading to the Grammys typically sees a string of major parties put on by record labels, but the majority have been cancelled in response to the fires, which have killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of structures. Money will instead be diverted to those in need. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\u201d Mason said. \u201cIt will honour some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d The annual tradition that will go ahead in Clive Davis\u2019s legendary gala, which takes place the night before. This year\u2019s event will also include a fundraising element. \u201cWe want to ensure that the evening will not only be a memorable night of music but will also provide impactful support for those very much in need,\u201d Davis said. This year\u2019s nominees are led by Beyonc\u00e9, whose country album Cowboy Carter brought her 11 nods, making her the most nominated artist ever alongside husband Jay-Z. Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to win the award for album of the year and if she wins this weekend, she would be only the fourth Black woman to take it home. The star has been nominated for the award four times before. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won album of the year,\u201d Jay-Z said last year on stage. \u201cSo even by your own metrics, that doesn\u2019t work. Think about that. The most Grammys, never won album of the year. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 has already become the first solo Black female to top the country charts in the US and could make history if she wins in the country categories on Sunday. The singer, whose mother Tina Knowles lost a home in the fires, has donated $2.5m to relief efforts. In the category of album of the year, she faces competition from stars including Andr\u00e9 3000, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx and Taylor Swift, who won last year. Swift, who has now won 14 Grammys, has also donated to a number of wildfire funds. In an Instagram statement, urging others to also contribute, she wrote that it was \u201cheartbreaking to see the stories unfold\u201d. The singer has been confirmed to present an award on Sunday. The evening will be hosted by Trevor Noah and feature performances from multiple nominees Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter with a special tribute to the late Quincy Jones, featuring Stevie Wonder and Janelle Mon\u00e1e. \u201cIt\u2019s Grammy week,\u201d Roan wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. \u201cI am very emo. My heart feels warm and fuzzy with all the support I have been given this past year. I hope you can understand that this has been incredible and scary and spiritual and confusing.\u201d The evening lands in the middle of an awards season that has seen delays and shifts as a result of the ongoing wildfires. The Oscar nominations were delayed twice and a tweaked ceremony will remove original song performances and spend more time trying to \u201cacknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires\u201d. The Critics Choice awards were also delayed until 7 February. This week also saw a benefit concert in Los Angeles with stars including Olivia Rodrigo and Joni Mitchell performing.",

        "headline": "You and I are gonna live forever: why 2024\u2019s pop was all about sharing the moment",
        "trailText": "Pop may be full of solo artists and individually tailored streams, but the Eras tour, Brat summer and Oasis reunion showed we still long to be part of a crowd",
        "bodyText": "The past year brought with it intriguing musical movements, not least a sudden pivot towards country by a succession of mainstream pop stars. Heralded by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Cowboy Carter album and amplified by the release of Post Malone\u2019s F-1 Trillion, the trend also brought huge hits for the hitherto-unknown Shaboozey and Dasha, while Zayn Malik called on the services of a Nashville producer and Lana Del Rey announced a country-influenced album. 2024 also brought with it new stars, most obviously Chappell Roan, who had spent the best part of a decade plugging away in obscurity, being signed then dropped by a major label, before releasing a debut album that slow-burned its way to the top of the charts: The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess initially came out in 2023 to little response (one of its biggest hits, Pink Pony Club, was first released four years ago). As with Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 whose 2024 breakthrough Short N\u2019 Sweet was her sixth album \u2013 Roan had clearly had the space to work out exactly what she wanted to do and how she wanted to present herself, with appealingly idiosyncratic and uncontrived results. But the most striking thing about pop in 2024 was the way it was dominated by a handful of huge, monocultural stories, which spilled out of the music pages into the mainstream news agenda. Continuing from 2023, Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour began the year being described as bigger than the Beatles and Thriller by support act Phoebe Bridgers and ended it officially the highest-grossing tour in history, making Swift a billionaire in the process. By the time it arrived in the UK this summer, the clamour made it impossible to avoid. But it was superseded in the headlines by the release of Charli xcx\u2019s Brat and the announcement we were living through a \u201cBrat summer\u201d: whatever the rather nebulous concept of being \u201cbrat\u201d signified, the idea took dramatic hold, turning up everywhere from the US election campaign to the New Statesman\u2019s posthumous appreciation of Edna O\u2019Brien and the pages of National Geographic, which proclaimed Cleopatra, Lucrezia Borgia and 7th-century Chinese empress Wu Zetian were all \u201cbrat\u201d. Then Oasis announced their 2025 reunion tour. For weeks, it was unavoidable: loud and lengthy expressions of joy; equally loud and lengthy expressions of horror; controversy regarding ticket prices; rosy-hued 90s nostalgia; bitter recriminations regarding the failings of 90s pop culture; and explorations of the curious phenomenon of teenagers too young to remember Oasis\u2019s 2009 split, let alone their golden years, yet apparently thrilled by their reappearance. On the face of it, these three mega-stories were all quite different. The Eras tour had a sense of finality \u2013 it was difficult for even the most hysterical devotee to see how Swift could possibly top this career-summarising greatest hits show. The success of Brat, meanwhile, seemed to herald a new era in mainstream pop that was messier, brasher, wittier and wilfully trashier, a reaction to years of self-help platitudes, wellness culture and perfectly choreographed pop. (You could see something similar in Roan\u2019s drag-inspired aesthetic \u2013 the cover of her single Good Luck, Babe! had her sporting a prosthetic pig\u2019s snout \u2013 and in Carpenter\u2019s gleefully acidic lyrics.) At the risk of sounding like the writer trying to crowbar Charli xcx into a piece about Edna O\u2019Brien, one could argue the V-flicking Gallaghers are, well, brat; if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to wellness culture and self-care bromides, they\u2019ve got a song called Cigarettes and Alcohol that\u2019s very much in favour of both. But their reunion was still predicated on nostalgia, with even teenage fans buying into a myth of the 90s as a kind of prelapsarian age, before social media and smartphones, that was less fraught than the present day. And yet, all three stories had something in common. For years now, pop has favoured the individual over the collective \u2013 this year groups such as Flo have continued to struggle, and some of the biggest global hits were from newly solo K-pop stars such as Jimin of BTS and Ros\u00e9 and Lisa of Blackpink \u2013 and the way pop is consumed has also narrowed. Streaming\u2019s algorithms serve up music ostensibly tailored to your own personal tastes. The price of tickets has turned gig-going into a special occasion you indulge in once or twice a year rather than enjoy on a regular basis. Fandoms have become weird, often troubling things that seem to exist as disembodied online entities firing pissy, anonymous social media messages to their idol\u2019s rivals. The things music fans used to gather around \u2013 TV and radio shows, the music press, even the charts \u2013 are either fading in importance or essentially defunct. Yet there remains an innate desire for collective experience, for music to provide a sense of community. You could see it in the burgeoning popularity of dance music: a DJ like Sammy Virji may have made little impact on the charts, but he can still sell out two nights at Brixton Academy; the nocturnal dance events at Glastonbury were so over-subscribed, some had to be closed down due to overcrowding. You could see it in the crowds that flocked to the Eras gigs, who seemed noticeably different from other pop audiences, and were big on intriguingly homespun rituals \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as if Swift or her management had told them to come in costume, or trade friendship bracelets, or draw the number 13 on their hands, or develop a series of if-you-know-you-know responses to particular moments in certain songs. You could see it in a willingness to buy into the notion of Brat and Brat summer, a way of defining yourself, however nebulously, through music in a post-tribal era, when pop is supposed to have lost its ability to affect the way its audience defines itself. And you could see it in the commotion caused by the return of Oasis. Whatever else you make of it, Oasis\u2019s oeuvre is absolutely predicated on collective experience: their songs sound like songs written specifically for vast crowds of people to bellow along to en masse; they\u2019re probably best experienced in the middle of said crowd, drunk, with your arms around your friends. Indeed, collective experience is so entrenched in Oasis\u2019s appeal that their music has literally become a signifier of it. In recent years, advertisers have reached for Stand By Me and Round Are Way in commercials tagged, respectively \u201cit\u2019s a people thing\u201d and \u201cwe can all do our bit for our community\u201d. So perhaps that\u2019s the underlying message of pop in 2024: people still want to be part of something bigger than themselves, and they\u2019ll still use pop to do it, even in an age when audiences are supposed to be atomised and individually sated by the algorithm. If it is, that\u2019s a hopeful note to end a frequently hopeless year on.",

        "trailText": "Stars must now be booked so far in advance for events that organisers can only guess who will sell tickets in two years\u2019 time",
        "bodyText": "Nobody in 2023 would have guessed that Sabrina Carpenter or Chappell Roan would be festival headliners in 2025, or that the Foo Fighters\u2019 rumoured summer tour would not go ahead after Dave Grohl became the father of a baby girl born \u201coutside of [his] marriage\u201d. But despite the unpredictable side of the music industry, live events are being organised further and further in advance. Top music venues are now booking two years ahead, locking in acts for 2027, and festivals are rushing to announce lineups earlier than ever. With a shortage of headliners and tours increasingly expensive to run, hot new artists are already being scouted out for 2026, and the industry is changing the way it operates. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely all happening more in advance,\u201d said Finlay Johnson from the Association for Electronic Music. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a trend of festivals booking acts earlier. Primavera Sound in Barcelona announced its lineup in October, and it takes place in June this year, which means negotiations would have started before their last festival even happened. Others have followed suit. Partly, they want tickets to be on sale for as long as possible, but they also want to secure headliners as there are fewer acts available.\u201d Few musicians are capable of drawing a broad cross-section of fans. \u201cPeople seem to be buying tickets based on name recognition,\u201d said Kelly Wood, national organiser for live performance at the Musicians\u2019 Union. In turn, mid-level artists who in the past might have significantly contributed to a festival\u2019s sales are now \u201creally struggling\u201d. By playing on the largest stage and getting prime social media exposure, existing headline artists keep getting bigger \u2013 further distancing themselves from other acts, exacerbating the situation. \u201cThe gap between the top and the middle is really, really stretched,\u201d she said. John Rostron, chief executive officer of the Association of Independent Festivals, said \u201cpretty much every established festival\u201d now has its lineup for the following year announced by the end of November, when it would normally have been done by the end of January. \u201cThe timelines have shifted.\u201d Top agents say they are being given 48-hour expiry times on offers and are under pressure to say yes, creating the risk they might undersell their acts if they subsequently win an award, top an end-of-year poll, or explode in popularity. Glastonbury, which is more popular than ever and sold out this year\u2019s tickets in 35 minutes, remains an outlier and has not yet announced its bill for the summer. However, it was confirmed earlier this month that Neil Young would headline the Pyramid stage after he had previously said he would be pulling out. The festival recently reported that it had more than doubled its profits last year. Early indications suggest that 2024 was also a strong year for stadium tours, notably Taylor Swift, according to UK body PRS for Music, and the biggest performers, such as Adele, have opted for artists-in-residence shows, where fans travel from all over the world to one venue. Touring artists face many financial challenges, including increased US visa costs, equipment delays at EU borders and the huge increased cost of crew, lighting and bus hire. Ticket prices for live shows have risen, especially with the dynamic pricing model, which adjusts according to demand, and festival prices have also gone up. \u201cIt used to be 60 quid a pop, now it\u2019s going to cost 250 to 300,\u201d said Wood. As a result, audiences have come to expect more for their money. Bigger and more complex tours need to be planned well, which takes a long time. LED screens, high-level production, extra musicians and dancers are just the start. \u201cIt costs huge amounts to put on big shows, and it\u2019s understandable when you hear how many people are actually working on them,\u201d said Wood. \u201cIt\u2019s a travelling circus.\u201d At festivals, where promoters often foot the bill for stage production, this creates further pressure to secure headline acts that can guarantee ticket sales. Sacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser to Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, said there are \u201conly a handful of artists who can pull these shows off\u201d, and the rest of the industry is nervous. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really tough this year.\u201d According to the Music Managers Forum, 72 festivals were lost in the UK in 2024, some permanently, and some temporarily through postponement. Likewise, many venues find themselves in precarious situations and \u201ceveryone is feeling the pressure\u201d, said the forum\u2019s chief executive, Annabella Coldrick. Some prestigious London venues are trying to stay nimble, deliberately keeping slots open in case they miss the next zeitgeist act like the Last Dinner Party, Wet Leg or Myles Smith. But with more new music now coming out than ever before, can promoters really predict what people want to see in a live setting? Johnson thinks not. \u201cIf you\u2019re booking for 2026 and doing the negotiations now, you\u2019re capturing a moment in time \u2013 and the audiences in 2026 might not feel the same way as they do now.\u201d \u201cBookers are essentially making a bet on the next two years, and it\u2019s that nothing better will turn up,\u201d said DJ Paul Rose, aka Scuba, who hosts the Not a Diving podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s not a vote of confidence in the industry.\u201d",
